            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS not more out of Reſpect to our own Innocency, and the Honour of our Religion, that theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers come abroad into the world, than it is from that Love and Reſpect which we bear to the King, whoſe Intereſt in the hearts of his People is greatly ſupplanted and undermined, by the courſes which have heen lately taken to deſtroy his Innocent and Loyal Subjects, upon a forged and groundleſs pretence, That they are engaged in a Conſpiracy againſt his Perſon and the eſtabliſhed Government. For ſome men, whoſe crimes have made them obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the juſtice of Parliaments and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Laws, could bethink themſelves of no other way to eſcape the puniſhments which they have deſerved, but by poſſeſſing the King, That the Peers and Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi> who are moſt likely to call them to an account, while they are complaining of their Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb facs="tcp:199172:3"/> and Offences, are themſelves combined to deſtroy both the Regnant Prince and the Monarchy. The hazards which our Names, Fortunes and Lives are brought into, do not ſo much afflict us, as to ſee the King loſe the Love and Confidence of his People at home, be forced to abandon his Allies abroad, and leave his Crown and Dignity, as well as theſe Nations, expoſed to the Power and Ambition of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Monarch. Nor can we expreſs greater <hi>Fealty</hi> to the King, than by plainly informing him, that he hath no Enemies, ſave the Papiſts, unleſs it be in the imaginations of ill men, who to render themſelves innocent, would make others guilty. And were they capable of being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cted, to forbear the proſecution of their forged Plots, upon the <hi>Baffles</hi> which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon proſecutions, ſupported meerly by perjury and falſehood, we would have had that compaſſion for the honour of the Government and the ſafety of the Nation, as to have ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe ſheets. But ſeeing they obstinately perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb facs="tcp:199172:3"/> in their malicious deſigns, and are as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious as ever, to bribe and hire mercinary Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals to ſwear Treaſon againſt the beſt and moſt loyal Subjects which His Majeſty hath, as well as againſt the chiefeſt Patriots of our Religion and Liberties; We hope the world will pardon us, in defending our own integrity, and expoſing their rage and wrath. And let me aſſure them, that while they fondly imagine they work under ground, we are able to trace them in the ſteps which they take. 'Tis not above a week or two ago, that by offers of five hundred pound a man, they attempted to ſuborn ſeveral perſons to ſwear Treaſon againſt the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and others. Nay, we could tell them of a <hi>Conſult</hi> which they had, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and digest the forged Evidence, which by greatexpence, and mighty labour, they had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; how they went away wonderfully diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed that it would not anſwer their deſires, nor ſupport the deſign which they were upon. As the people of <hi>England</hi> are not of a temper, to ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:199172:4"/> their throats to be cut in a way of maſſacre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a manly and generous reſiſtance; ſo they are not of a complexion, to loſe their Lives unjuſtly, by a legal proceſs, without ſpeaking in their own defence. What we have here written, is with a freedom that becomes innocent perſons, tho' we muſt acknowledg, that we have fallen ſhort in the air and ſtile that are proportionate to ſo just a cauſe. The righteeouſneſs and innocency of our caſe, needs no pickquancy; and it were but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and darken our Loyalty, to make it reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by colours. But if our Enemies perſevere in their ways of impudence, we hope all mankind will acquit us, if from henceforth we lay aſide baſhfulneſs and modesty.</p>

Nay, the Author of the Preface to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Ridley</hi>'s Book <hi>de Caena Domini,</hi> who is commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been <hi>Grindal,</hi> that was afterwards Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a perſon who by his circumſtances and troubles in the time of that Bloody Reign, and by his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quality under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had as fair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages as any, of being informed concerning the number of thoſe that ſuffered, tells us that there were above <hi>Eight hundred</hi> put to moſt cruel kinds of death for Religion in the firſt two years of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> perſecution.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſo peſtilent and infectious a thing is <hi>Popery,</hi> that when once it hath inſinuated it ſelf, into, and poſſeſt the minds of Princes, it not only infatuates them to depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Kingdoms, by deſtroying and driving into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the beſt and moſt uſeful ſubjects of their dominions; but it ſo far <hi>faſcinates</hi> them, as to make them forget their own protection and defence, as well as to abandon the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and preſervation of thoſe of their people that agree with them in the ſame belief; and to chuſe rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199172:6"/> their Crowns, Territories, and Subjects, to be ſubdued and conquered by an Aſpiring and Rival Monarch, or to enforce their ſubjects, purſuant to principles of ſelf preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to revolt and rebel, than they will be perſuaded and prevailed upon to exerciſe Indulgence, Compaſſion, and Forbearance to Proteſtants, tho' at the ſame time they cannot but know that the people whom they perſecute, would ſacrifice their Lives and Fortunes in the defence and ſervice of their Perſons and Dignities.</p>
            <p>Thus the Second and Third <hi>Philips</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to embroil the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> in an expenſive and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy War, and at laſt to loſe the Obedience of Seven intire Provinces, and ſee them ſhake off their dependency upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and eſtabliſh themſelves in an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and Soveraign Government, than to allow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that People to differ and diſſent in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And as the Revolt of thoſe Provinces, which was occaſioned meerly by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Proteſtants, proved at firſt the great obſtacle to <hi>Spain</hi>'s obtaining the Univerſal Monarchy, which they were in a condition to have bidden fair for, had not that War and the withdrawment of ſo many great and rich Countreys interpoſed; ſo the expence of Wealth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of men which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were at during thoſe long and bloody troubles, with the loſs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which renounced their Allegiance to <hi>Spain,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected themſelves into a <hi>Free State,</hi> hath laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of abridging the Intereſt of that Crown in <hi>Europe,</hi> and is like to iſſue in the ruine and ſubverſion of that Mighty and Large Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Thus likewiſe the preſent <hi>Emperor,</hi> notwithſtanding the urgency of his Affairs through the impreſſion which the <hi>French</hi> have made upon <hi>Germany,</hi> rather than abate the perſecution of his Proteſtant <hi>Hungarian</hi> ſubjects, he hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199172:6"/> hitherto choſen to venture the ruine both of the Empire and his own Hereditary Countreys. And tho' that poor people have been always ready to render an intire obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Imperial Majeſty, and ſtrengthen and encreaſe his Armies with a brave and large Military Force to oppoſe and withſtand his Enemies, provided only that their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Legal Rights might be ſecured unto them; yet that Prince through the influence of the Popiſh Clergy, and eſpecially of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> hath preferred the expoſing himſelf and all <hi>Germany</hi> to the Power and Ambition of <hi>France,</hi> rather than gratifie the Requeſts of his Proteſtant ſubjects, albeit the whole which they have demanded and inſiſted upon, was ſtipulated unto them by the Oaths of his Anceſtors. And ſeeing his own Neceſſities, and the ſober Counſels of his beſt Friends, have at laſt brought him to terms of Agreement with that people, I ſhall only wiſh that they may not through the liberty which the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion giveth him of violating Promiſes made to Hereticks, be departed from and forgotten as ſoon as the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the danger he is in from the <hi>French</hi> bloweth over and vaniſheth.</p>
            <p>I might alſo here add, That there is a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world, who tho' he have at preſent no other pretence to the Government of Affairs, ſave what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys by the Favour and Indulgence of his Prince; yet through his being corrupted and infected with Popiſh Principles, he ſeems to prefer the entangling Three Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and Opulent Kingdoms in Inteſtine Wars, or the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them naked to the Invaſion of a Mighty and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Neighbour, than loſe the opportunity of extirpating the Northern Hereſie, and reducing the Nations, where his Counſels and Intereſt can prevail, into a Vaſſalage to the Triple Crown.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:199172:7"/>
            <p>And we may yet more fully ſatisfie our ſelves, what we are to expect from Papiſts, and what their Religion guides them unto, and juſtifieth them in, if we will but conſider what the Sufferings of the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> at preſent are, and what methods are purſued for the extirpating of them. For as all the perſecution which they undergo, is commenced againſt them for no other cauſe but barely that of their Religion; ſo to give the <hi>French</hi> King his due, he is ſo juſt as to acknowledg it, and ſcorns to palliate the true cauſe of their Oppreſſions, Baniſhment, and Slaughter, by pretending that they have conſpired againſt his Perſon and Government, and that their Aſſemblies for the Worſhip of God, are intended for, and employ'd in the ſtirring up Sedition. He is ſo generous, as not to mention the ſeveral Wars which thoſe of the Reformed Religion undertook and managed for their own defence againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth; but he tells them that they have been always very loyal to him, and that he apprehends no trouble or danger from them on the account of their Principles; only he is reſolved not to ſuffer any in his Dominions who will not embrace the Popiſh Religion; and that they muſt either renounce the Faith which they profeſs, or ſubmit to be deſtroyed. It would require a <hi>Volume</hi> rather than a <hi>Paragraph,</hi> to recount the many late <hi>Edicts</hi> which have been publiſhed againſt them, and the ſeveral ſteps and methods which have been taken to ruine them, without their being guilty of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime or provocation, ſave their having withdrawn themſelves from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus the King hath not only demoliſhed an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Churches, and ſuppreſſed the exerciſe of Religion where it had for a long time been legally enjoyed; but the Proteſtant Miniſters are every where expoſed to be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt and puniſhed, whenſoever any ſuborned wretch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199172:7"/> ſhall but depoſe, that they delivered ſomething in their Sermons that was ſcandalous upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And they have not only ordered, under great and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Penalties, That no Papiſt ſhall turn <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and that none who have forſaken the Proteſtant Religion, tho' out of infirmity, lightneſs or fear, ſhall return to it again; but they have alſo ordained, That the Children of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> ſhall be admitted to abjure their Religion at ſeven years of Age, and in caſe they have no mind after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to live with their Parents, that their Fathers and Mothers ſhall be obliged to maintain them wherever they pleaſe to continue or be. It were endleſs to recount the hardſhips which the Proteſtants in that Kingdom are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for beſides their being turned out of all offices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they got a Subſiſtence for themſelves and Families; their Wives are not to be brought to bed, but by Midwives or Chyrurgeons that are <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nor their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren taught, unleſs it be meerly to read and write, ſave by Popiſh Schoolmaſters. Nay, as if it were not enough to forbid them to be Stewards, Bailiffs, Solicitors, Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Clerks, Notaries, and to remove them from all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Affairs of the <hi>Finances</hi> or Cuſtoms, and turn them out of all Military Commands by Sea and Land; they have commanded all Chyrurgeons, Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, Watchmakers, and divers other Artificers, to ſhut up their ſhops, which is in effect to require them, either to turn Papiſts, or to ſubject them to ſtarve. And to all the other miſeries, which that poor people are made liable unto for their Religion, this is not the leaſt, that they will not ſuffer them to die in quiet, but have enjoyned, that when they are ſick, they ſhall ſuffer themſelves to be viſited by a Popiſh Magiſtrate in the preſence of two Popiſh Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without allowing any <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> tho' their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relations, to be by. And as we may eaſily apprehend,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199172:8"/> that their errand is either to diſturb them, that they may not expire in quiet; or by the utmoſt Cunning and Art to prevert them from departing in the ſame Faith, which they had all their days profeſſed; ſo they think it not only a lawful, but a meritorious Act to ſay, that they died in the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' they know the contrary to be true. And thereupon they take away all their Children to breed them in the Popiſh Religion, and ſeize the Eſtate to preſerve it, as they pretend, for the Children of ſuch Catholick Parents. In a word, the ſufferings and calamities of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> are grown to ſuch a height, that many thouſands have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their native Country, Relations, Friends and Eſtates; and the reſt are ready to do the like, were they not debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ways of departure and eſcape. And as the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities exerciſed againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion in that Kingdom, are but a Copy of what we in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to look for, in caſe we ſhould come under a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prince; ſo the time hath been, that the Rulers of theſe Kingdoms, and ſuch as Miniſter at the helm of of publick Affairs, would not have ſilently lookt on, and ſuffered thoſe of the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> with themſelves, to be thus oppreſſed and deſtroyed for no other Reaſon, but meerly becauſe they are <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Nor will it be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to the Honour and Reputation of ſome people in the World, That the firſt <hi>Edicts</hi> of any fatal Conſequence to the <hi>Hugonets</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> bore date in 1660. as if the <hi>French</hi> King had preſumed upon the Connivence of his Neighbours, and therefore adventured to begin the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution which hath been by ſeveral ſteps advanced all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſince, and is at laſt arrived at inexpreſſible, as well unſupportable ſeverities and rigours. And I may ſay, that it is not without grief and ſorrow, that they who love his Majeſty, are neceſſitated to obſerve, how through the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199172:8"/> influence of ill men about him, he hath ſuffered himſelf to be perſuaded to neglect interpoſing ſo effectually in behalf of that people, as was expected from a Prince profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion, and whoſe intereſt it is to ſhow himſelf upon all occaſions the Patron and Defender of all the Reformed Churches. And whoſoever they were that adviſed His Majeſty to abandon the concerning himſelf in the favour of Proteſtants beyond the Seas, they neither conſulted the Glory and Honour of their Prince, nor yet the Maxims which His Royal Father, as well as others who have ſwayed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter, were guided by. And tho' no good ſubject can think of the Uſurper <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell,</hi> but with an abhorrency of the Crimes which he was guilty of towards the Royal Family and theſe Kingdoms; yet all the World took notice, and continues to acknowledg, both with what Sympathy, Courage, and Zeal, he appeared in behalf of the Proteſtants in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> when their Prince the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had employ'd Forces, and given Orders to extirpate them; and how by a Letter to the late <hi>French</hi> Cardinal, he check'd and ſtem'd a Perſecution which ſome Proteſtants in the South of <hi>France</hi> were likely to have fallen under. The poor <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> did not only long ago foreſee all that hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to overtaken them, but they likewiſe made ſome near His Majeſty acquainted with it, and were ready to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſuch meaſures as would have been able to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their own ſufferings, and the diſturbance which the <hi>French</hi> Monarch hath given ſince to <hi>Europe,</hi> had they been believed and hearkned unto. But alas! inſtead of taking that poor people into our protection and care, or entring upon thoſe Counſels with other Princes, which the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the ſecuring unto the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants the liberty of their Religion called for, all the Intelligences we received were communicated
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199172:9"/> to the <hi>French</hi> King, upon which they became not only diſcouraged from placing any confidence in our Miniſters for the future, but one poor Gentleman who had ventur'd to treat with a certain perſon near his Majeſty, had the misfortune to be broken upon the Wheel, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are forced upon the like account to live in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Exile from their Country. And yet even they by whom they were betray'd dare not ſay, that ever they found them enclined to depart from their Allegiance unto their own King, or to enter into any Confederacies unbecoming good Subjects and natural <hi>Frenchmen;</hi> but that all which they aimed at, and were willing to have tranſacted about, was only, that in preſerving their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to their Prince, they might not be ſuffered to be ſacrificed and rooted out merely for their Religion.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Stipulations of Kings, or the eſtabliſhed Laws of Kingdoms, any ſecurity unto <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for their Lives or their Religion, if once the <hi>Papiſts</hi> eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves furniſhed with a ſufficient Power, and a ſeaſonable Opportunity to ſubdue and extirpate it, or them. For as the Pope can Abſolve all ſuch Princes from the Promiſes and Oaths which they make to their Subjects; ſo it is a known Principle of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks. And where the Prince, by not having the whole Legiſlation in himſelf, is reſtrained from repealing <hi>Old</hi> and Enacting <hi>New</hi> Laws at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he will either mould and influence thoſe who have a ſhare with him in the Legiſlation, to a compliance in what he deſigns; or he will venture at the trampling upon all Laws, and through the efficacy of the Principles of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, will purſue the Extirpation of Hereſie, in defiance of all Boundaries preſcribed unto him by the Law. For what greater aſſurance could the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have for the Liberty of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199172:9"/> and the preſerving unto them all the Rights and Priviledges of <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> than they enjoyed by that <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, commonly ſtiled the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> from the City where the King was, when it was concluded; and yet notwithſtanding that <hi>Edict,</hi> they are treated as if they were neither Chriſtians nor <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> being deprived of all that was therein granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and brought to ſuffer every thing which that <hi>Edict</hi> was purpoſely made to defend them from. For whereas by the ſaid <hi>Edict</hi> they have a great number of Churches allowed unto them for the open exerciſe of their Religion; and it is ordained, that it ſhall be left free for any <hi>Papiſt</hi> to turn <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and that thoſe of the Reformed Religion ſhall be as capable of enjoying publick Charges, Honours, Royalties, and of exerciſing any Art or Trade, as the Roman Catholicks themſelves ſhall be, and that there ſhall be no difference betwixt <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> as to the ſecurity of their Lives, the ways and means of their ſubſiſtence, their authority over, and freedom of educating and diſpoſing their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; yet through an implacable hatred which <hi>Popery</hi> inſpireth men with againſt all that differ from them in Religion, they are rob'd of all that was therein eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in their favour, and ſubjected to all the miſchiefs which the fury of their malicious enemies, and the power of a Prince guided by Father <hi>le Chaiſe</hi> the Jeſuit, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon them. And as the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, tho confirmed by <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, proves no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants againſt the preſent Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which they are groaning and periſhing under; ſo it is to be feared, that the Laws which the Proteſtants in other parts of the world do truſt unto for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Religion, Lives and Legal Rights, will be as inſignificant to the ſecuring theſe unto them, in caſe they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199172:10"/> ſhould fall under the power of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince, or that the Counſels of Miniſters Popiſhly inclined ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, as the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes</hi> hath been to the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> For it is obſervable, that as the <hi>Scots</hi> have at all times te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified as much Zeal for the Reformed Religion as any people in <hi>Europe</hi> have done, ſo they took care to eſtabliſh the continuance of it to them and their Poſterity, by as good Laws as any Nation in the world could; yet upon finding how uſeleſs ſuch Laws, as I ſhall name, are unto the ends for which they were made and enacted, there is a wonderful Jealouſie poſſeſſeth the generality of that Kingdom, That nothing can preſerve them from being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved again to <hi>Popery,</hi> but His Majeſties outliving the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> For it is Ordained by the Law of <hi>Scotland, That no man is to</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 6. p. 6. Act. 9.</note> 
               <hi>bear any publick Office within that Realm, but ſuch as profeſs the Proteſtant Religion: And that none who ſhall not make profeſſion</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 6. p. 3. Act 47.</note> 
               <hi>of the ſaid Religion, ſhall be reputed a Loyal and Faithful Subject to the King, but be puniſhable as a Rebel: And that whoever ſhall at any time happen to Reign and bear Rule over that Realm, ſhall at the time of his Coronation, and the receipt of his Princely Authority, make his faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 6. p. 1. Act. 8. Charles I. p. 1. Act. 4.</note> 
               <hi>by Oath, in the preſence of the Eternal God, That during the whole courſe of his life, he ſhall ſerve the ſame Eternal God, according to the uttermoſt of his power, as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in his moſt holy Word, revealed and contain'd in the old and new Teſtaments, and ſhall according to the ſame main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the true Religion then profeſſed and received within that Realm,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore ſeeing theſe Laws have not been ſo obſerved but that one who doth not profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, hath contrary unto them wrought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199172:10"/> himſelf into the chief adminiſtration of Affairs there under His Majeſty, hath preſided daily in Council, and ſate as the Kings Commiſſioner in Parliament; they begin to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that other Laws may prove as ineffectual for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Proteſtant Religion to the Nation, as theſe have been to the excluding one from the higheſt Places of Authority and Truſt under the King, who hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf for the Proteſtant Religion, as the foreſaid Laws do require.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is not to be queſtioned but that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of this Kingdom in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, thought they had gotten their Religion ſo eſtabliſhed by Laws, that there was no fear of the reintroduction of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, whoever ſhould afterwards aſcend the Throne; and yet Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was no ſooner come to the Crown, than contrary to the Law of the Land, as well as her promiſe to the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men who had eſpouſed her Title and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> ſhe publiſhed a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to forbid and inhibit all Preaching and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the Scripture, without her ſpecial Licenſe. Which was to ſubject the Reformed to puniſhment if they offended, whereas the Papiſts were ſure not only to be pardoned in caſe they tranſgreſſed, but were thereby in effect countenanced to reſtore the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Worſhip and Service. And when a Parliament was called, there was not only violence uſed in divers places, to hinder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons from aſſembling to chuſe, and the election of ſeveral who were judged fit for the Queens turn, promoted by force and threatnings; but there were many falſe Returns made, and ſome duly elected forcibly turned out of the Houſe. Upon which all the Laws againſt Popery came eaſily to be repealed, and new Laws made for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Reformed Religion, and the perſecution of Proteſtants. Which as it ſerveth to convince all that have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199172:11"/> not wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt light, and who are not reſolved with a brutiſh obſtinacy to withſtand reaſon, what we are to expect from a Popiſh Succeſſor, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Laws which we enjoy for our ſecurity; ſo the rage wherewith the Papiſts are at preſent tranſported and inflamed againſt the Proteſtants of theſe Kingdoms, and the temper of the Gentleman whom they labour to ſee advanced to the Throne, may cauſe us reaſonably to fear and apprehend ſeverer perſecutions in caſe he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the weilding of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Scepter, than ever our forefathers under Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſuffered or met withal. For the <hi>Scheme</hi> which he hath ſet in <hi>Scotland,</hi> while he is but a Subject, and greatly reſtrained by the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Authority of His Majeſty, from accompliſhing half of what we are to ſuppoſe him inclined unto by his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, may ſufficiently ſatisfie all mankind what he is like to prove, ſhould he ever come to act with an uncontrolled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and have an opportunity to diſplay the complexion of his mind. His proceedings againſt the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> do not more ſurpriſe all the World, than they proclaim how little he values the Lives of the Greateſt and moſt Innocent Peers, if they will not become ſubſervient to his Intereſt, and inſtrumental in his Popiſh and Arbitrary Deſigns. And as the Earl's offering to explain in what ſenſe he was willing to take the Teſt, is a thing which no Law can juſtly forbid, and which a Cobler might have done in <hi>England,</hi> in the like caſe, without being ſo much as liable to a rebuke; ſo it is not unworthy of the knowledg of the World, that he communicated the Explanation to his Highneſs beforehand, and deſired to know whether he might not be allowed to take it with the Proviſo's which he afterwards mentioned in Councel. And as the Duke did not prohibit, but ſeem'd to permit, at leaſt to connive at what was propoſed; ſo it is remarkable, that the ſaid
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199172:11"/> Earl was ſuffered to take his Place in Council after he had taken the Teſt in the ſenſe which that Explanation did import. But his Intereſt in the Kingdom, and his ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, adminiſtring matter of diſlike and jealouſie, ſeeing nothing more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or really Criminal did occur, were thought fit, after ſome Nocturnal thoughts, and private Conſults, to be laid hold upon for the ruining a Perſon, vvhom as they could not manage to the ſervice of their purpoſes, ſo they dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the prejudice he might do them by running croſs to their Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Earl of <hi>Argyles</hi> entertainment more ſevere in having that called Treaſon, vvhich the common reaſon of mankind, and all the Lavv of the World juſtifies; than it is expreſly contrary to the Lavv and Practiſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to condemn, attaint, and forfeit any, unleſs they either are or have been in actual Rebellion, but ſuch as are perſonally preſent, or have had Warning given them to appear. But the unpreſidented Severity vvhich this Great and Wiſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman hath had meaſured unto him, may be a Warning to all His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, what they are to expect, if this <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> arrive once to be King of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Laws which we ſo much rely upon, will avail us, if we be found to thwart his will and humour.</p>
            <p>And as Laws are no ſecurity to Proteſtants againſt the Malice and Cruelty of the Papiſts, when once they are armed with Force and Power ſufficient to deſtroy them; ſo neither the Liberty and Priviledges which the Papiſts are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally to enjoy with our ſelves, nor the Favours and Civilities which we have been ready upon all occaſions to heap upon them, can reſtrain or hinder our being ruined, whenſoever they are furniſhed with an opportunity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and aceompliſh our extirpation. The Bloody Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199172:12"/> of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to the <hi>Suffolk</hi> Proteſtants, who in effect ſet the Crown upon her Head, and the barbarous Severities exerciſed at preſent againſt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who not only with the expence of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Blood eſtabliſhed <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th on the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> when the Princes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him, but by their Courage and Valour preſerved the Soveraignty unto him, that at this time perſecutes them, when the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> would have wreſted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of his hand, are ſo many uncontrollable Arguments and Demonſtrations, that no Merits or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices can ſecure Proteſtants from the Rage and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Malice which the Popiſh Religion inſpireth men with. And as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre ought never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Proteſtants of theſe Dominions, ſo it had this ingredient to aggravate the Barbarity of it, that it was perpetrated at a ſeaſon, when inſtead of having any reaſon to complain of their uſage by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they were in the quiet poſſeſſion of equal Priviledges almoſt with themſelves. But if we will deſcend to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and take a view of what the condition of the Papiſts hath been ſince His Majeſties happy Reſtoration, we ſhall eaſily perceive, what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful generation of men they are, and that they are not capable of being obliged by kindneſſes. For, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, who of all men deſerved leaſt lenity from a Proteſtant Government; it is remarkable that notwithſtanding the Rebellion, wherein they had been ingaged, and the infinite ſlaughters which they had committed in a time of Peace, without the leaſt provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adminiſtred unto them; yet there hath not any Law been made againſt them ſince the King's Return, ſave one againſt their living in Walled Towns, which was ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Majeſties Command expreſſed in a Letter to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199172:12"/> Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> and Council from being put in execution. And as to the ancient Laws which vvere in being and force againſt them, that vvhole Kingdom ſwarming with Prieſts and Friers, and their celebrating Maſs every where with as much openneſs as the Parochial Miniſters do preach the Word, or read the Liturgy, are undeniable Evidences how little thoſe Laws have been applied to their hurt or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Nay, they have been not only connived at in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>introduction of the vvhole Popiſh <hi>Hierarchy</hi> into that Kingdom, and allovved the holding a Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Papal Clergy by a Commiſſion from the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> in the year 1666. for their Sitting; but they have equally, vvith His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, been advanced to ſeveral places of Civil Power and Truſt, ſo that when the Plot was to have been executed in <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1678. there were no fewer than fifteen <hi>Sheriffs</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were either profeſſed and avowed <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or ſuch as bred and educated their Children in that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And yet while this Forbearance and Tenderneſs have been expreſſed to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſuch of His Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects as in that Kingdom diſſent from the Eſtabliſhed Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, have fallen under the misfortune of having an expreſs Law made againſt them, and divers Loyal Subjects, who profeſs the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in all its Doctrinal Articles, have been proſecuted to Fine and Impriſonment upon it. And as to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> they were ſo far for many years after His Majeſties Reſtoration, from having any new Laws made againſt them, that they never felt the weight of the old ones. For ſaving the open exerciſe of their Religion, whereof they have been reſtrained, they enjoyed the ſame ſafety as to their perſons and eſtates, which the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Liege people did. Nay, many of them beſides their having the perſonal favour of the Prince equally with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199172:13"/> others, they were admitted into Places and Employments of Profit and Truſt. And tho by their late Helliſh Plot they are made liable to ſome Teſts, or to be diſabled from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Parliament, and rendred uncapable of publick Truſts; yet notwithſtanding the provocation which the Nation might have juſtly conceived againſt them upon the account of that Damnable Conſpiracy; there hath not to this day been any new Laws made againſt them for their Religion; nor can they with any truth and juſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the rigorous execution of thoſe which had been enacted before. Whereas notwithſtanding the agreement that is between all His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects in the Fundamental points of Religion, thoſe that are called Proteſtant Diſſenters have not only been proſecuted ſince His Majeſties Reſtoration, upon ancient Statutes which were purpoſely made &amp; intended againſt none but Popiſh <hi>Recuſants,</hi> as well as upon that of the 35 of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> which being alſo made upon the dangers that the Kingdom was in from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as appears by the Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Debates of the greateſt Stateſmen who were in that Parliament, ſeems to have been originally deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt none but them [<hi>vide Townſend</hi> Hiſtorical Collect.] but there have beſides been no fewer in one kind and othet, than five ſeveral new Laws, and theſe none of the gentleſt, enacted againſt them. And while the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have hardly felt the ſeverity of the Laws, which are in force againſt Popiſh Recuſancy; the Proteſtants have unconceivably ſuffered by virtue of the <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt Diſſenters from the Government, Diſcipline, Rites and Liturgy of the Church; and upon a Law for <hi>Regulating Corporations,</hi> whereof the moſt material terms were judged inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, burdenſome and grievous, when intended to have been impoſed upon others in the form and manner of a Teſt.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:199172:13"/>
            <p>Now having ſuggeſted theſe things both in the feweſt words I can, and with all imaginable regard and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Truth; we ſhall in the next place with the like ſincerity and briefneſs, intimate and recount what Plots, Conſpiracies, and Deſigns, the Papiſts have of late years been engaged in, and purſued, to the ſubverſion of our Religion, and the deſtruction of our Lives and Liberties, notwithſtanding the tenderneſs of the Government to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and the excellent Laws which we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with and enjoy, both for the ſecurity of all theſe unto us, and for our protection from the Machinations of all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Enemies. And tho' the methods wherein they have acted, and the ſteps they have taken, have been ſo ſecret as well as various, that it is impoſſible fully to trace and diſplay them; yet ſo much is obvious to all who do not wilfully ſhut their eyes, that by relating only what we demonſtratively know, we may be able to form a judgment concerning their Councels and Actings, which lye more concealed and hid. It is to the influence which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have had upon our Publick Miniſters, that we owe the Enacting of thoſe Laws, which as they were directly calculated to ruin many of His Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, ſo they have weakned the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Intereſt in theſe Kingdoms, by encreaſing our Differences, and inflaming Jealouſies, Heats and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities amongſt us. And if it was not from ſome of our Councellors being under their Guidance and Conduct, that we embarkt in a bloody and expenſive War with our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Neighbours, <hi>Anno</hi> 1665<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them and our ſelves, and the giving opportunity to a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince to aſpire to a formidable growth; It was certainly from the Power and Intereſt which they had in ſome truſted with the manage of our Affairs, that the <hi>Triple League</hi> came to be diſſolved, an Alliance contracted with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:199172:14"/> the <hi>French,</hi> and a Second War, wherein we were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and betrai'd by our new Confederate, begun <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1672. againſt the <hi>Dutch.</hi> I will not deny but the Grounds and Cauſes of our quarrelling then with them, might be weighty and juſt; yet ſeeing it appears ſince by the Declarations which the <hi>French</hi> King cauſed to be made by his Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> that his invading them at that time by agreement and concert with us, <hi>Was to extirpate thoſe Hereticks, and deſtroy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie;</hi> I ſuppoſe our Miniſters may not only find reaſon to believe, that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Councels did more influence our Reſolves and Affairs of State, than they were aware of; but to wiſh they had not encouraged His Majeſty to that War, and rather to have ſought to adjuſt differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us in an Amicable way. And ſince our being through that aſcendency which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have over ſome great Perſons near His Majeſty, engaged in a cloſe and ſtrong Conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> King; It is not to be imagined what advancement the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have made to the ruining of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt through all <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as in theſe three Nations. For as the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy do univerſally apply themſelves to the promoting the Grandeur, Empire and Soveraignty of <hi>France,</hi> in hopes that he will enſlave all thoſe to their Religion, whom he ſubdues to an Obedience to his Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; ſo they have all along, by the impreſſions which they make upon our Miniſters, been endeavouring to prevail over us, not only to remain Neutral, while he is purſuing his Conqueſts, but to contribute to his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by aids of Men and Ammunition. Nor is it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable ſtep and advance, which by keeping us linkt to <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have made to the ruin of theſe Nations, in that they have hereby cauſed a wonderful miſunderſtanding between His Majeſty and his People,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:199172:14"/> and filled the beſt and wiſeſt of the King's Subjects with jealouſies, that it is through a concert with that foreign Monarchy, that Parliaments are either Called, Prorogued or Diſſolved. And as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in theſe Nations are emboldned by the Confederacy between us and <hi>France,</hi> to maintain an intimate and dayly Correſpondence with that <hi>Court;</hi> ſo it is juſtly to be apprehended, that they have made themſelves ſure of Supplies of Power and Succour from thence, whenſoever they ſhall judge it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſet upon deſtroying our Religion, and altering the Government. But beſides all which they have either endeavoured, or been able to effect towards the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us and the Reformation in theſe Nations, through the influence which they have had upon Miniſters of State and Publick Councels; they have entred into Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for the overthrowing Religion and extirpating <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> wherein we are inclinable to believe, none have been truſted but themſelves. And as the Burning of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1666. was the firſt plain and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evidence, that the freedom of their own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the private liberty of their Religion, would not content them; but that they were implacably bent upon the ruine of all His Majeſties Liege people, who differ from them in Principles of Faith and Worſhip; ſo we are well aſſured, that their Malice and Rage had not terminated in the firing our Houſes, but that they would have mingled the blood of the inhabitants with the aſhes of their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, had not the courage and ſpirit of ſome of their own party failed them, and had not the Citizens been awaken'd to a ſenſe of their danger, and appeared reſolute to fell their Lives at a dear rate. And tho we are moſt ready to believe that none had a hand in the contrivance and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Villanous Deſign, but the Papiſts; yet the reſcuing ſome out of the hands of Officers and others,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:199172:15"/> who had been taken in the very act of throwing Fireballs, and diſmiſſing divers without proſecution, againſt whom the ſame Fact was ſworn, clearly argues, that the Authors and Inſtruments of that horrid Crime, had many great and potent Friends, who were forward to protect them from the puniſhment and demerit of it. But the Papiſts having miſs'd the opportunity of cutting the throats of the Hereticks, when they were under a conſternation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; and finding that the Flames of <hi>London</hi> had enlightned many concerning their Deſigns, who vvere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both ſecure and poſſeſt vvith more favourable thoughts concerning them, and perceiving that notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Mercinarineſs of the Members of the Long-Parliament, there vvas no hope of biaſſing them by Bribes and Penſions either to eſtabliſh Popery by a Lavv, or ſo much as give an univerſal Toleration to the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;</hi> they arrived at laſt to theſe Devilliſh Reſolutions, of Murdering the King, and Maſſacring all the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proteſtants in the Kingdom. This vvas the Plot into vvhich all their Contrivances at laſt reſolved, and vvhich they had determined to have executed in the latter end of 1678. For the conſtant expence vvhich they vvere at in carrying on the Conſpiracy, being grovvn ſo burdenſome, that they could not much longer maintain and ſupport it; and the Parliament being after the breach of the Triple League, and the formidable grovvth of <hi>France,</hi> become leſs manageable to the ſubſerving their more calm and leiſurely Deſigns; and finding vvithall, that the Nation begun to fear and apprehend that the Papiſts had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing in agitation; but eſpecially the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and dread they vvere in leſt His Majeſty might not live the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> in vvhom they placed all their hopes of obtaining the re-eſtabliſhment of their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry, ſhould he once aſcend the Throne, vvere
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:199172:15"/> the motives and inducements upon which they determined to defer and adjourn matters no longer, but to put all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one deſperate and bold adventure. Nor could they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect to be in circumſtances which could promiſe them a greater moral certainty of ſucceſs, than they were in at that time. For as the Power, Forts, and Strength of the Nation, were either in Popiſh hands, or entruſted to ſuch whom they might ſo far rely upon, as not to fear any conſiderable oppoſition from them; ſo the Duke of <hi>York</hi> who is known to be a perſon as zealous for the Papal Cauſe, as any of themſelves, was ready to have aſſumed the Crown; and if not inclined to authoriſe directly what the Papiſts were to do, yet forvvard enough, as vvell as capable through his poſſeſſing the Regal Povver, to fright Proteſtants into a quiet ſubmiſſion to the Svvords of their Enemies, or declare them Rebels that ſhould dare to arm for ſelf defence. And as there vvas no leſs than <hi>Twelve hundred thouſand pounds</hi> payable at that time into the Treaſury, being the money vvhich vvas granted for the carrying on a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> the thoughts whereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired vvith the paſſing of the Bill; ſo there vvas a formed Army of <hi>Thirty thouſand men;</hi> vvhich having been raiſed upon the ſame pretence, vvould have been ready to have received and obeyed the Commands of the King that vvas deſigned to ſucceed. And if the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Conſpirators in conjunction with that Army, ſhould have proved too few to diſpatch and extirpate the Hereticks in theſe Dominions, all things were ſo well adjuſted, the Peace of <hi>Nimmeguen</hi> being at that time ſo near a concluſion, that the <hi>French</hi> King, whom for divers years the Papiſts have depended upon, and accordingly intereſted him in all their Councils, could without the abandoning his concernments abroad, have aſſiſted and ſupplied them with large and powerful ſuccours. Nor is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199172:16"/> it to be imagined, how the murder of the King, which as it was to have been the firſt <hi>Scene</hi> of this new <hi>Tragedy,</hi> was alſo to have been charged upon the Phanaticks, would have enraged one half of the Proteſtants againſt the other. For having obtained Mr. <hi>Claypool</hi> to be impriſoned about that time in the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon a forged accuſation of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, That he, and Two hundred more had reſolved to kill the King, they thereupon reckoned, that could they but ſucceed in the deſigns which they had formed againſt His Majeſty, the Proteſtant Diſſenters would both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>odium</hi> of it, and feel the revengful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of the Nation. And then after that many of the Proteſtants had embrued their Hands, and dyed their Swords in one anothers blood, it was determined, that the reſt ſhould fall as a Sacrifice, to be offered up by the Roman Catholicks to the Holy See. Thus according to the beſt Rules and moſt ſolid Foundations that men are to judg of the ſucceſs of Deſigns, they might very rationally think themſelves ſecure of effecting and accompliſhing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they intended. Nor was the King ever in a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſecurity, or they who were deſtined to be ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with him, leſs provided of means for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>But God would not abandon his Worſhip and Truth, nor ſurrender an infinite number of innocent people to the rage and fury of the enemies of his Name and Glory: For it is to him alone, that we owe the diſcovery of this Papal Conſpiracy which as it hath filled all Europe, as well as theſe Three Nations with wonder and horror; ſo the truth and reality of it is ſupported, and put beyond all doubt and queſtion, by the moſt convincing, and uncontroulable Evidence that a Matter of Fact is capable of. The King hath teſtified his belief of it by ſeveral Proclamations. Four ſeveral Parliaments, upon the moſt impartial enquiry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:199172:16"/> which they could make, have declared, that they are fully aſſured there was ſuch a Deſign, the Conſpirators own Letters and Papers confirm and juſtifie the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Witneſſes who detected it; the flight of ſome, and Condemnation of divers of the principal Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, have reconciled it to the belief of all who were not either intereſted in it, or did not at leaſt wiſh, that it might have ſucceeded. Yea, the preparations of Horſe and Arms, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had been known to make before hand, proclaim aloud the Deſign upon which they were at ſo vaſt an expence; and the murdering one Miniſter of Juſtice, and doing all they thought needful to Aſſaſſinate another for diſcharging their Duty in the detection of it, are ſo many undeniable Evidences of their being guilty of what they are accuſed of. But notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Wickedneſs of vvhat was intended, and the clearneſs of the Proof to convict them; yet ſuch is their Influence upon Publick Miniſters, and ſo great is their Povver in all our Councels, that vve can neither obtain the having the principal Conſpirators brought to Legal Trial, nor procure any effectual proviſion tovvards the ſaving our ſelves, and ſecuring our Religion from their Cruelty and Rage. Inſtead of ſeeing them proſecuted according to the demerit of their Crimes, or finding any proportionate means uſed to diſcourage and check their Deſigns, we have not only beheld ſuch Juſtices turned out of the Commiſſion of the Peace, who vvere moſt zealous againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and Arbitrarineſs; but we have ſeen four ſeveral Parliaments Diſſolved before they could bring Offenders to Juſtice, make a due and thorough inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Plot, or put the Kingdom into a poſture of Safety from the dangers vvhich threaten it from <hi>Popiſh</hi> Counſels, and the claim vvhich a <hi>Papist</hi> may pretend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to the Throne. And vvhatſoever His Majeſties care
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199172:17"/> and zeal have been either for the Diſcovery of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, or the bringing them unto condign Puniſhment; yet his Royal Intentions have been ſo ill ſeconded, that ſeveral Prieſts, as well as others vvho ſtood accuſed, have been firſt harboured near his Royal Palaces, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed beyond Sea in Yachts belonging to ſome that are nearly related unto his Royal Perſon. The dread of diſpleaſing one Gentleman, doth ſo prevail over the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vvhich every man owes the King, that vvhen His Majeſty had commanded by his Proclamations that all the <hi>Papists</hi> ſhould be diſarmed, ſcarce one of a thouſand had ſo much as a Piſtol or Sword taken from him. Our Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Juſtices have been under thoſe impreſſions of fear, leſt they ſhould offend great men, that neither the regard which they ought to bear to their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Religion which they ſeemingly profeſs, nor the tenderneſs which they are bound by their Fealty and Allegiance to have for His Majeſties Safety and Life, have been powerful enough to cauſe them to keep that hand over the Papiſts, which the Laws of the Land do at all times require, and which the preſent circumſtances we are in from thoſe of that Religion, render moſt indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary. Some are enclined to believe, that it is not the leaſt of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Crimes, that he was the only man of Quality in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who after the Diſcovery of the Plot, took out a Commiſſion for diſarming the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. And it is not improbable, but that the Authority which he hath in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> and overawe the Papiſts there by vertue of his being Lord <hi>Juſhiciary</hi> in thoſe parts and his being able upon any occaſion to check and bridle the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntley</hi> from attempting any thing to the diſturbance of the Kings Peace, and the prejudice of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> was one main reaſon and ground of his late Proſecution. However this is not unworthy of our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199172:17"/> that My Lord <hi>Mac-Donals</hi> invading the Shire of <hi>Argyle</hi> with an armed Force, merely for being required by the foreſaid Earl, to deliver up his Arms, was never called to an account, yea ſcarce ever received a <hi>Reprimand</hi> from thoſe in Authority under His Majeſty in <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' when he had a <hi>Herauld</hi> ſent to him by the Council, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to disband his Forces, he tore his Coat from his back, and ſent him home to <hi>Edenborough</hi> with all the marks of contempt to them, and diſgrace to the Officer. But may be, that Lord being a Papiſt, his Religion is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough by ſome to attone for his Treaſon. But as a further evidence that the Papiſts, notwithſtanding their late horrid Conſpiracy, have been both protected from the Juſtice of the Law, and left ſtill in a capacity to execute their Deſigns againſt the Hereticks, it is remarkable, that tho' a Proclamation was publiſhed in <hi>Ireland</hi> for ſearching the houſes of all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks for Arms, yet when the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Galloway</hi> went in purſuance thereof to ſearch the Earl of <hi>Clanrickards</hi> houſe, where, as he was informed, all the <hi>Papists</hi> in that County had lodged their Arms, the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> produced a Warrant from my Lord Lieutenant the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> that his Houſe ſhould not be ſearched. And do we not therefore upon the whole ſee, that whereas the Papiſts were in a wonderful conſternation upon the firſt Diſcovery of the Plot, as apprehending from the knowledg which they had of their own Guilt, what they deſerved to have inflicted upon them, how they are of late not only grown ſceure and jolly, but more rampant and inſolent than ever?</p>
            <p>Nay, ſo great is their Intereſt and Power, by means of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and ſuch whom he either overaweth or otherwiſe influenceth, that they do not only eſcape the puniſhments which they are liable unto for their Treaſons; but they have obtained to have the Laws made
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199172:18"/> againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters, to be executed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Rigour and Severity, while in the mean time them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are as good as connived at in the violation of all the Statutes Enacted againſt Popiſh Recuſancy. For this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to proceed originally from the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo inconſiſtent with that Princely Wiſdom which he hath always manifeſted, when not over-ruled by the importunity of Ill Men. How unlikely is it, that a Prince who receiveth and indulgeth Foreign Proteſtants, ſhould at the ſame time encourage the diſtreſſing his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that do no otherwiſe differ from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than as thoſe Foreigners do? Nor can it be the advice of any ſincere and true Proteſtant, to have the Laws executed at this ſeaſon and juncture againſt <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> it being ſo apparent a weakning of the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Intereſt in theſe Kingdoms, and a betraying all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party into the power and hands of their worſt Enemies. And ſeeing none but the <hi>Papists</hi> can reap any benefit or advantage by it, it muſt be they and none elſe that were the firſt Authors, and continue to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of ſuch Councels. And as ſome of theſe Laws were procured by the means of Sir <hi>Thom. Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Thom. Strickland</hi> and others, who have ſince appeared to be <hi>Papists;</hi> ſo it is not unpleaſant to obſerve how they have endeavoured to get them either ſuſpended or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, according as this or that have lyen in an uſefulneſs to their Deſigns. Nor can we otherwiſe believe, but that as ſome of our Miniſters obtain'd them to be diſpenſed with 1672. in favour of the Papiſts, ſo others purſue the having them put in execution in 1682. out of friendſhip to the ſame people. Thus the Laws, which were preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at firſt to have been made for the preſervation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have been from time managed to ſet forward the concernments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:199172:18"/> advance the projections of the <hi>Papists.</hi> Accordingly we have beheld them ſuſpended for divers years, when both moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy were earneſt to have had them executed, and when the execution of them ſeemed to lye in a ſubſerviency to ſupport the grandeſs of the Church; But now when neither the Church can be able to ſubſiſt, nor are any means left to the preſervation of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Religion, unleſs Moderation and Lenity be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to Diſſenters, we are made daily and ſad Spectators of Oppreſſion, Spoil and Havock brought upon a quiet, induſtrious and uſeful people, by the execution of theſe very Laws. And we may be ſure the <hi>Papists</hi> hug and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themſelves, to find that through the Aſcendency which they have over ſome Publick Perſons who influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence all our Counſels, they can apply the Laws to the ruin of many <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and in revenge for their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſcaped their murderous and bloody hands, engage the Government and Authority of the Nation againſt them. Nor is it leſs than a matter of Triumph to them to think, that when the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled had not only read and committed a Bill <hi>For the uniting His Majesties Protestant Subjects;</hi> but Reſolved it as the Opinion of that Houſe, <hi>That the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Protestant Diſſenters upon the penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the Subject, a weakning to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Interest, an encouragement to Popery, and dangerous to the peace of the Kingdom;</hi> they ſhould not only be able to alienate and exaſperate us more from and againſt one another, than ever we were, but procure one Proteſtant to proſecute another upon the Penal Laws, to the ſcorn and contempt of the Wiſdom of Parliaments, and the proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the world of how little eſteem and value their Counſel and Advice are. What effect theſe proceedings upon the Penal Law againſt Diſſenters may have upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199172:19"/> who are not Phanaticks, is not eaſie to be throughly apprehended; but it is certain that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to cenſure whatſoever is extremely rigorous, and to compaſſionate ſuch as ſuffer merely for Religion, &amp; not for Crimes againſt the peace and ſafety of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How ſoon did the Nation grow diſſatisfied with the Cruelties of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and even they who had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion themſelves, came to abhor the ſeeing their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men burnt for Principles which had no influence upon the ſubverſion of Thrones, and diſturbance of Societies? Yea, tho her ſecond Parliament revived the old Laws againſt Hereticks; yet the minds of men were ſo much altered in a little time, that the <hi>Commons</hi> in the third Parliament of that <hi>Queen,</hi> would not paſs a Bill which was brought in for incapacitating thoſe from being Juſtices of the Peace, that were ſuſpected to have been remiſs in proſecuting He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. And it is remarkable, that not only our late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were for the mitigation of the Laws againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and for the uniting all His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects; but even the Long Parliament, which had been the Authors of all the new Laws againſt Phanaticks, ſaw a neceſſity, if they would preſerve our Religion, and the Lives of Proteſtants from the dangers which threatned them by means of the Papiſts, to take other meaſures than they had acted by before, and to recur to Methods of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Accordingly the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> in the Seſſion that was held <hi>February</hi> 1672. ſent up a Bill to the <hi>Lords</hi> in favour of Diſſenters, and about the Union of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Nor is it to be imagined what jealouſies it raiſeth in the minds of moſt people concerning what they and all Proteſtants are to fear in caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, by ſeeing many of the ſobereſt in the Nation, and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the preſent Church in all Doctrinals of Faith, and Eſſentials of Worſhip, ſo ſeverely treated and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:199172:19"/> under a Proteſtant King, only becauſe of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from thoſe of the eſtabliſhed National way in ſome little and inconſiderable things. And by how much all this rigor againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters is thought to have its riſe from the counſels and importunity of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> by ſo much are all thinking men poſſeſt with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing apprehenſions of the Cruelties which they muſt expect to undergo, if he come once to wear the Crown. For being univerſally ſuppoſed and taken to be a Papiſt, and thereupon of a Faith altogether oppoſite to ours; ſo we are not now to learn, that the very principles of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief will oblige him to extirpate all that will not own the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Creed. Yea, ſuch people as dare ſpeak their thoughts, do commonly ſay, That the reaſon why the Duke adviſeth His Majeſty to courſes ſo contrary to the Meekneſs and Compaſſion of his Royal Breaſt, as well as the whole tenor of his Reign hitherto, is that he may darken and eclipſe the Glory of His hitherto merciful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and by putting him upon auſterities towards ſubjects who profeſs the ſame Religion that their Prince doth, juſtifie himſelf hereafter in all the Slaughters and Barbarities which by virtue of the malicious ferment of Popery, he may be inclined to perpetrate upon thoſe whoſe Religion he ſo implacably abhors, as he doth that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. But would it not be worthy of the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe at the Helm, That it is not only the Diſſenters who ſuffer by the Execution of the Penal Laws, but the whole Nation which participates in the profits and advantages of their Induſtry. More eſpecially all they who have any relation unto, or ſuch as manage any Commerce with them, do all bear a common ſhare in their Calamities. And beſides the recentments which will ſpring up in the minds of men, by ſeeing an innocent people haraſſed, whoſe Lives tho they do not imitate, yet they cannot but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:199172:20"/> commend; will it not be apt to impreſs their hearts with ſecret diſguſts, to ſee a Body of men ruined and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, in whoſe hands three parts of four through the whole Kingdom have leſs or more of their Intereſts involved? And whereas none ſave the Informers are either deſirous or likely to gain by theſe violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the King being too generous as well as good, to ſell his Treaſury with the ſpoil of the oppreſſed; would it not become our Publick Miniſters to conſider, whether it be a congruous and wiſe thing, to glut and ſatisfie the Avarice of an idle and unprofitable ſort of people, not only at the coſt and expence of many honeſt and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Families that will be ruined, but at the vaſt dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Trade of the Nation, and proportionably the leſſening the King's Profit and Revenue? Nor are ſuch as do fully conform to the Worſhip, Diſcipline and Ceremonies of the Church offended as well as ſurprized, at the ſeeing Diſtreſſes levied upon their harmleſs Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, only for their Conſciences towards God; but they are wonderfully alarm'd at the manner in which they are daily diſſeized of their eſtates, being without the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and <hi>Verdict</hi> of a Jury. Such was the care of our Anceſtors for the ſecurity of our Eſtates as well as our Lives, that by that which is conſign'd to us as the <hi>Common Law</hi> of the Land, we have this fence and bulwark to guard our Property, That we ought not to be diſpoſſeſt either of the whole or any part, but upon a hearing and trial by a Jury. I know that by the <hi>Acts for preventing and ſuppreſſing Seditious Conventicles,</hi> ſuch and ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as are therein named, have a power given them to levy the reſpective Fines that are impoſed upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without the Enquiry or <hi>Verdict</hi> of a Jury; but I alſo know, that an Act of Parliament hath not heretofore been ſufficient to juſtifie and protect thoſe, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199172:20"/> the Properties of men and diſſeized them of their Eſtates, without a previous and Legal Trial. Tho' <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> thought themſelves ſecured by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Statute made in the 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. in what they did of this kind, yet that Act was not only repealed in the 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for being contrary to the juſt Rights of the Subject, and the Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> but they who ventured to act upon it to the oppreſſion of the people, were Condemned and Hanged for ſo doing. And as the counſel and advice for the execution of the Penal Laws upon Diſſenters, at a ſeaſon when both our Lives and Religion are in eminent danger and hazard by reaſon of the Plots and Conſpiracies of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> can proceed from no other perſons but ſuch as favour <hi>Popery,</hi> and would promote the bloody Deſigns of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo who knows but that the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> being a ſurly people, may by way of repriſal Indict many of his Majeſties Conformable Subjects upon other Penal Statutes, to which either upon one ſcore or another, moſt of them will be found liable. And as it would ſavour of too great Partiality in the Government to grant a <hi>Noli proſequi</hi> for the Relief and Protection of ſuch, ſhould they come to be proſecuted, when at the ſame time it is found coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing and encouraging the proſecution of Diſſenters, upon Laws which are not in themſelves better, more juſt or uſefuller to the preſervation of the publick Peace, and the maintenance of good Manners; ſo it would be little for the reputation and credit of ſuch as ſuperintend and guide affairs, to ſee the whole Kingdom turned into a Cock-pit, and one Subject ſcratch, pluck and haraſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Nay, were the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> inclined to retaliate upon others, what is daily meaſured out unto themſelves, they want not conſiderable advantages from Statutes, of leſſening, if not wholly deſtroying, ſome conſiderable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:199172:21"/> branches of His Majeſties Revenue. For beſides the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and prejudice it would give the King in the matter of the <hi>Exciſe,</hi> ſhould Alehouſe keepers be Indicted upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 21 of <hi>James, cap.</hi> 7. where it is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. <hi>That whoſoever ſells a Pot or Quart of Ale for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Penny, ſhall for every ſuch offence forfeit twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> and which the <hi>Act of the 22 and</hi> 23 of this King can no ways relieve them from, ſeing the Clauſe by which they were indempnified from that Penalty is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: I ſay, beſides this, the <hi>Act</hi> concerning the Exciſe is not ſo diſcretely and carefully penned, but that occaſion may be taken by a diſcontented people, to diſpute and debate the validity of it in ſome particulars, which if carried, would altogether overthrow it. Nor is it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but that the Severity which the Diſſenters ſuffer and undergo upon the Statutes againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> may ſo awaken and provoke them to enquire into the Nature, Form and Quality of thoſe Laws, that upon a Legal and fair hearing they may be found to have no concernment in them, or the Penalties of them. For as they ſeem not to come within the reaſon of thoſe <hi>Acts,</hi> becauſe they were made, as the Title and Preface to them do declare, only to <hi>prevent and ſuppreſs Seditious Conventicles,</hi> which the Diſſenters by aſſembling for the Worſhip of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the revelation of his Word, are no ways chargeable withal; ſo it doth not plainly appear, that the body of theſe Acts which ſubject thoſe only to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, <hi>Who worſhip God in other manner, than according to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi> England, doth any ways extend unto them. The Diſciples of Chriſt and all Chriſtians may be as truly and rationally accuſed of diſobedience to their Teacher and Saviour, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are found praying in any other words than thoſe contained in the Lord's Prayer, ſeing Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:199172:21"/> hath bid us <hi>Pray after that manner;</hi> as the Diſſenters can be juſtly Informed againſt or Indicted, <hi>For worſhipping God in other manner than according to the Liturgy,</hi> merely becauſe they read not the Prayers of the Church. And to all that hath been ſaid, I hope this may be modeſtly added, That ſhould the Phanaticks by the execution of the Penal Laws be driven to extremities, and left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all other means of relieving themſelves, they may poſſibly become ſo far exaſperated and incenſed, as to queſtion and bring into debate the validity of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Laws upon which they ſuffer. For tho' I do not take upon me, nor preſume to ſay any thing againſt the Force and Legality of them; yet no man can undertake what a rich and courageous people may do, that is ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd by and inſeſted upon them. And ſhould the Parliament that met the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> in the 13th of this King, be found to have exceeded the time which the the Act of the Sixteenth; <hi>Car.</hi> cap. 1. <hi>For preventing of Inconveniences happening by the long Intermiſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> had appointed and limited for their continuing to ſit, before they once thought of Abrogating and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing that Statute, which they did not till the <hi>Seſſion</hi> that begun the 16th of <hi>March</hi> in the 16th of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. then the Laws by which the Phanaticks are Diſturbed, Fined and Impriſoned, will not be found to have the Legality, Force and Power that ſome men do imagine. But the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who at the bottom are the promoters of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Severities againſt Diſſenters, are no ways ſolicitous concerning the Inconveniences which may enſue; all they aim at is to alienate the hearts of the People from the Government, inflame Differences and Animoſities among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> foſter Jealouſies in the King of the Loyalty of his Subjects, and by all this to render us the eaſier a prey unto themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:199172:22"/>
            <p>And ſince the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Conſpirators were prevented in the execution of the Deſign which they had ſo carefully laid, and carried on with ſo much Induſtry, Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Expence at home; and which had it ſucceeded, they apprehended themſelves ſecure of a Foreign Succour, as well as a Prince of their own Religion to ſupport and juſtifie; as they thereupon found themſelves rendred both obnoxious to the Juſtice of Parliaments, and the angry Reſentments of the Nation; ſo they have been making it their chief buſineſs, either to get their own Plot wholly disbelieved, or to forge and ſham one upon <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Accordingly when they could neither cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Witneſſes, who had made the Diſcovery of their Villanies, to retract their Teſtimony and renounce their Evidence, nor were able either by the perſons whom they had ſuborned here, or thoſe whom they had brought from beyond Sea, to weaken and defame their Credit; they do at laſt entirely betake themſelves to the framing a Plot, wherein they would have it believed the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> are involved and engaged for the ſubverting of the Monarchy, and altering the Government. And as the endeavouring to impoſe the belief of ſuch a fooliſh and obvious Forgery upon the Government and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a clear demonſtration of the Truth of their own Conſpiracy, and the deſperate ſhifts which their Guilt and Fear have driven them unto; ſo the entertainment which ſome have given to ſo dull as well as <hi>Romantick</hi> a Fable, is both an undeniable Evidence, that there were more acceſſory to the firſt Popiſh Plot, than yet are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly accuſed, and that there are a ſort of people in the Kingdom, who are only ſorry for the miſcarriage of it. We might very reaſonably have thought, that upon the detection of the <hi>Meal Tub Sham,</hi> in the year 1679. the Papiſts would either have been diſcouraged to forge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199172:22"/> another perfectly of the ſame Figure and <hi>Make,</hi> in the year 1681. or that the Government would have received the tidings of it with neglect and indignation. For as it is the ſame Deſign whereof we are now accuſed, that we were to have been charged with then; ſo theſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom they have procured Witneſſes to ſwear Guilty of a Deſign to ſeize the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> were the firſt in the Liſt of Nobles and Gentlemen, whom they were then to have Sworn againſt, That they reſolved to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt His Majeſty, and muſtered Forces to that purpoſe. How ſtrangely are we abandoned to the malice and will of our Enemies, that the Papiſts having miſt the deſtroying us by a Maſſacre, they ſhould be permitted by Perjuries and Subornations to purſue our ruine in <hi>forms</hi> of Legal Trial. And as the countenance which the vileſt Miſcreants have met withal, who tho apparently ſuborned and hired, have come forth to teſtifie a Proteſtant Plot, is an unanſwerable Argument under whoſe conduct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſome of our Miniſters are; ſo the baffles which the Authors and Managers of this Intrigue have received upon the Three late Adventures and Eſſays which they made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the proof of a Proteſtant Conſpiracy, do proclaim aloud what opinion all wiſe and good men have both of them and this whole Affair. Now tho the judgment of ſo many Juries upon a full hearing of what our Accuſers had to charge us with, be a ſufficient vindication of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of all the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> in this matter, as well as of thoſe perſons againſt whom the ſeveral Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were brought; yet we bear that reſpect to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Religion, the Reputation and Integrity of the laſt Parliament, as well as the Credit of our own Names, that we cannot believe we have diſcharged our duty as we ought towards the World, till we have both tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the folly, and expoſed the malice of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:199172:23"/> to that degree, as to render them the objects of the ſcorn and hatred of all Mankind. And as we ſuppoſe our ſelves in this Undertaking ſecure of the Approbation of His Majeſty, it being in favour of that Religion which He not only profeſſeth, but whereof He is the Defender, and in behalf of as Worthy and Loyal perſons as any in his Dominions; ſo in performing this moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty, we fear not the anger of Miniſters, much leſs the barkings of little people, being ſtedfaſtly reſolv'd not to ſay any thing but what we can approve our ſelves before God and man for the truth of. Nor can any without an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen eſpouſing the Deſigns of the Papiſts, be offended that we ſhould vindicate the Loyalty, and Juſtifie the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Proteſtants, which have been ſo impudently and maliciouſly aſperſed. Yea, it would be a tranſgreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Rules of Juſtice and Equity, to allow or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at the branding and arraigning us in daily Pamphlets, if they ſhould not permit us the liberty to detect the Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Criminations by which our Honour and Lives are invaded and brought into queſtion. And while the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits Plea, Staffords Memoirs,</hi> and <hi>the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Engliſh Catholicks from the pretended Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt the Life and Government of His Sacred Majeſty,</hi> eſcape the Cenſure and Animadverſion of our Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators of Juſtice, it would imply an entertainment of undue thoughts concerning the Juſtice of the Government, ſhould we not inſtead of a <hi>Reprimaud,</hi> expect their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Nor will we believe that it was either by the Authority of His Majeſty, or the Honourable <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> that a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> and the <hi>Wardens</hi> of the Company of <hi>Stationers,</hi> went to the ſeveral <hi>Printing-houſes,</hi> requiring them to publiſh nothing in favour of the Innocency of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> or in juſtification of the <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> which was brought in by the Jury upon the <hi>Bill</hi> that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199172:23"/> was preferred againſt him: but we rather aſcribe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſo unpreſidented and illegal an action, to ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious Agent for the Papiſts, or to ſome little Miniſters, who were apprehenſive of ſeeing themſelves laid open and detected, being conſcious of their own guilt in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encouragement they had given to this Forged Proteſtant Plot, for which many Noblemen and Gentlemen were deſigned to have been deſtroyed. For as there is no Law whereby the coming into mens Houſes, the making a ſearch after Books or Papers which may be in the Preſs, or the laying an Inhibition upon them of printing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they judg ſafe or convenient, is or can be warranted; ſo it ſeems no ways equal and fair, to reſtrain any man from doing himſelf right, when he hath been publickly as well as eminently injured. And truly it looks like an impoſing that upon the implicite Faith of the World, which they know themſelves unable to prove; or it argues a diſtruſt either of the goodneſs of their Cauſe, or that it hath not been managed with integrity and candor, when they are unwilling to admit both ſides the priviledg of being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard. For tho it may become the Wiſdom of men in Power and Government, to preſerve the Juſtice of Courts, and Reputation of Juries, from being openly arraigned, when an Indictment after a full Enquiry hath been approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and allow'd by ſuch as are the proper and only judges of it; yet ſuch a procedure as the reſtraining men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their own Innocency, and vindicating the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of thoſe who acquitted them after a full and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal hearing, can never adjuſt it ſelf to the ſenſe or reaſon of mankind. Nor doth ſuch a courſe and method import any thing leſs, than that for having miſs'd the ſatiating their Malice in the Blood of one or two whom they mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated, they will purſue their Revenge in endeavours
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:199172:24"/> to blaſt the Credit, and diminiſh the value and eſteem of all that have been inſtrumental in preventing and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Intendment.</p>
            <div n="shaftsbury" type="part">
               <p>NOW this Plot for Depoſing the King, and altering the Government, whereof <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were to be Accuſed and Impeached, was not only ſo contrived as that it might reach moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers and Gentlemen, who ſtood in the way of Popery and Arbitrarineſs; but the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> were to be brought under the charge and accuſation of it. For the Popiſh Conſpiracy having been carried on with the ſame vigour againſt the Lives of Proteſtants and the eſtabliſhed Religion in that Kingdom, as it was in this; and the Parliament here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far ſatisfied and convinced of the reality of it there, as well as in <hi>England,</hi> as to declare and teſtifie the belief of it by the unanimous Votes of both Houſes; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Papiſts in both Kingdoms were equally and by the ſame Artifices to be relieved from the imputation which lay upon them, and to be reſcued from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Laws Adjudged and Condemned them unto. Therefore the Proteſtants in both Nations were to be accuſed of having forged the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, and that having thereby amuſed His Majeſty and the people, they have in the mean time been fomenting and promoting a real one of their own. This was that which <hi>St. Laurence</hi> the Prieſt would<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See No Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Plot, Firſt part,</hi> p, 33, 34, 35.</note> have Hired and Suborned Mr. <hi>William Smith</hi> to Swear and Depoſe, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Evidence was ſo ſtrong againſt <hi>St. Laurence</hi> at his Trial, that tho' he was acquitted, yet he is ſtill believed by all impartial men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:199172:24"/> that heard it, to have been really guilty. For it is not only reported from thence by perſons who deſerve to be credited, that ſuch eſpecially were returned upon the Jury, who were known before-hand to have reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Smith;</hi> but it is moſt certain, that whereas the Priſoner was allowed <hi>five</hi> Councel to plead for him, there was none of the King's Councel, nor any one man of the Gown beſides, that appeared in behalf of the Evidence. Whether they forbore, from an opinion that the Evidence was ſo plain, that it required no Plea to enforce or apply it; or whether they did it out of deference to ſome great men, whom they would not offend, by being concerned in any thing that may prejudice the honour and integrity of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> or whether it was in obedience to the commands of ſuch, who would not have an Intrigue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, upon the diſcovery whereof the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may come to be thought peaceable and loyal again, as I cannot certainly tell, ſo I ſhall not take upon me to conjecture and divine. But beſides that which was ſworn againſt <hi>St. Laurence</hi> by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> which to any who read it, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear either the copy, tranſcript, or counterpart of what they have been doing here, we have other evidence of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> labouring in <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſham off their own Plot, by repreſenting it as a Forgery falſely laid upon them by the <hi>Prateſtants;</hi> and their endeavouring to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Government with a belief, that during the noiſe and buz which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had raiſed concerning a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, they were themſelves embarkt in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the King and the Monarchy. Thus whereas one Captain <hi>Morley</hi> had appeared before the Committees of Lords and Commons here, and ſwore two Conſults which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in reference to the extirpating the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion in that Kingdom; they have procured no fewer than ſix or ſeven <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,

But why the <hi>Papists</hi> ſhould in all their Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions introduce the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> affirming the King to be a Papiſt, and an enemy to thoſe of the ſame Religion which he not only profeſſeth, but which he hath ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolemnly Vow'd for ever to protect and defend, I think no wiſe man is able to tell; unleſs it be that they have a mind to recriminate upon us, what they have been proved guilty of themſelves. It is not yet ſeaſonable to declare by whoſe means and by what Arts the foreſaid Depoſition was obtained, nor how <hi>Handland</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phey,</hi> two fellows that came over hither to Swear the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot, were ſince their return transformed into Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to prove a Proteſtant Conſpiracy; but all theſe things muſt be foreborn till his Majeſty in his Princely Wiſdom, and from that Juſtice which he hath hitherto governed his people by, and in the diſcharge of his promiſe which his Loyal addreſſing Subjects, as well as others, do rely upon, be pleaſed to call a Parliament, and then both all theſe and many other things will be more fully diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſet in a brighter light. In the mean time this muſt be acknowledged to the Honour of His Majeſty, and the Juſtice of the Council-Board, that tho the foreſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was received by ſome in <hi>Ireland</hi> with great fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tranſmitted hither not only with all expedition
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:199172:25"/> and ſpeed, but accompanied with an earneſt deſire, that the Gentleman might be ſent thither; yet the King and Council would neither do ſo illegal and arbitrary a thing, as to ſend a perſon from hence to <hi>Ireland</hi> without his own conſent, both born and bred here, and who actually poſſeſſeth an eſtate in <hi>England.</hi> Nor could it be done without great Injuſtice, ſeeing the words wherein alone the Treaſon muſt lye, were owned to have been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken above two year ago. And for his being ſuborned by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to Swear Treaſon againſt the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Davies,</hi> it is remarkable, that he never teſtified any thing of that nature againſt them; and what he did declare in relation to them or any others, he referred himſelf for the truth of it to the Council-Books of that Kingdom, or to ſuch Depoſitions which had been either taken by the Council there, or had been tranſmitted to them by others. And as no man that is Maſter of ſenſe, and hath any knowledg of thoſe two Honourable Perſons, will ever ſubmit his Faith to receive ſo incredible a thing, as that they ſhould Suborn any man to ſwear falſly; ſo Mr. <hi>Morley,</hi> whoſe credit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſſeth that of the Witneſſes who ſwore againſt him, abſolutely denies that they ever did, or that he ever ſpake any ſuch thing concerning them. But they that can firſt invent, and then get ſo abſurd and impoſſible a thing as <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> received and believed, may be pardoned both in forging and in hoping to vvin credit to things ridiculouſly fooliſh, as well as abominably falſe. Nor could ſo dull a Fable proceed from any but people of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> underſtanding; neither vvill it obtain with any men, but ſuch as have renounced Reaſon as vvell as Honeſty. But there is yet a third, and that a more ſignal Inſtance of the Papiſts endeavouring to involve the Proteſtants in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:199172:26"/> 
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> under the guilt of a Plot againſt his Majeſty, and this diſplays and unfolds it ſelf in the Accuſation ſworn againſt Mr. <hi>Hawkins.</hi> The perſon charged is known to be an ingenious Gentleman, and one vvho hath always acquitted himſelf as became Honour, Diſcretion and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; only it is his fortune to be a Proteſtant, and was his unhappineſs to be made acquainted vvith ſome of the Popiſh Deſigns againſt the Government, which inſtead of furthering or concealing, he communicated to My <hi>Lord Lieutenant.</hi> That vvherewith he was charged, doth in all things ſo quadrate with vvhat we have heard Svvorn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> that we may boldly ſay, they vvere all coined in the ſame Mint. For one <hi>Mac-Gennis</hi> ſvvears, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Havvkins <hi>told him, he went for</hi> England <hi>to establiſh a Correſpondency with my Lord of</hi> Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>and that be received a Commiſſion from the ſaid Earl for a Troop of Horſe;</hi> and one <hi>Mackoghlin</hi> depoſeth, <hi>That he was to be a Trooper under Mr.</hi> Hawkins, <hi>and that he had three pounds from him towards the buying a Horſe.</hi> The very counterpart and direct parallel of what <hi>Booth</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed againſt Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> and vvhich he and <hi>Bains</hi> would have ſuborned the Captain to ſwear againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and were both hammered in the ſame Forge. But as the Devil and the Prieſts inſpire the Papiſts with falſhood and malice, ſo God to over-rule and defeat their Rage and Treachery, deprives them of common Wit and Underſtanding, and gives them up to all prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous folly and madneſs. For as <hi>Mackoghlin</hi> never ſpake with Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> but once, and that in the preſence of another perſon, and then he only endeavoured to have inſinuated himſelf into his Acquaintance, which Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> refuſed to admit him into; ſo it is moſt certain that Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> never converſed with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> nor
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:199172:26"/> ſo much as at any time ſaw him. And whereas it was ſworn by <hi>Mackgennis,</hi> That he ſhould ſay <hi>he came to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to eſtabliſh a correſpondence with that Nohle Peer; and that he received a Commiſſion from him for a Troop of Horſe;</hi> The whole matter depoſed is not only falſe; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which my Lord was at that time in, being a Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Tower, ſhows the impoſſibility that ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair ſhould be tranſacted between them at that ſeaſon. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelſs, that Ingenious and Loya! Gentleman was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> upon that Forged and Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Information; and had not the <hi>Proteſtant Plot</hi> been ſo far detected, as to be hiſſed off the ſtage by ſeveral Juries, it might not only have coſt Mr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> his Life, but laid a foundation for ſuperinſtructing a Conſpiracy upon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt Proteſtants of quality and zeal in that Kingdom would have been included, and firſt or laſt charged with the guilt of it. For there were no fewer than between <hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Thirty</hi> muſtered up of a ſudden to teſtiſie a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Plot;</hi> perſons, who as they believe implicitely in matters of Religion, they would likewiſe ſwear ſo for the Intereſt and Advantage of St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and the Holy Church. And beſides what they may reaſonably be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to receive out of the Catholick Treaſury for ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and uſeful a Service as the Swearing innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants out of their Lives and Eſtates, they had lately the confidence to petition the <hi>Council</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> that a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance might be allowed them from the State. And it ſeems but juſt and equal, that they ſhould be afforded the ſame encouragement, which thoſe liſted and employed upon the like Service in <hi>England</hi> have; and that they ſhould have ſome conſideration for the ſale of their Souls, tho they will be ſo reaſonable as not to keep up that Commodity to the price which it goes at and is valued here. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199172:27"/> fellows not only of a meer <hi>Iriſh</hi> underſtanding and breed, but ſuch as had converſed all their days in Bogs, and whoſe moſt refined and improved knowledg is how with hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs to ſteal Horſes and Cows, might be found defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in art and cunning to manage this Meritorious work of Swearing with ſome conſiſtency to themſelves and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; there are ſome lately arrived there from hence, who having been trained and inſtructed here by the grand Maſters of the Forgery and <hi>Affidavit</hi>-School, may be able to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and diſcipline thoſe raw blades in the neceſſary Virtues of Perjury and Impudence, and acquaint them with the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable method of rehearſing the Depoſitions which had been given them to <hi>con,</hi> without adminiſtring any <hi>ſymptoms</hi> of their ſpeaking by <hi>rote.</hi> But their underſtandings not being ſo docile and flexible as their Conſciences, they make daily ſome unfortunate and fatal miſadventure. And their having publickly accoſted the greateſt perſons with rude and inſolent <hi>Menaces,</hi> and their having threatned to accuſe every one whom according to their knowledg of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World, they do but apprehend to have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, they have already ſo enfeebled their Credit with all ſorts of men, that they are altogether become uſeleſs and unſerviceable. It is far from my intention to bring all the natural <hi>Iriſh</hi> under this Character; for tho moſt of them who continue Papiſts, would eſteem it not only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, but meritorious to cut a Proteſtants throat; yet there are thouſands of them who from ſome principles of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and Bravery, do deteſt the deſtroying Proteſtants in the baſe and creeping ways of Subornation and Perjury. And we deſire to be pardoned for this ſevere Cenſure which we have faſtned upon the Raſcality of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation, ſeeing beſides the impreſſions we retain of them by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacre, and the freſher intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:199172:27"/> we have received of their regardleſneſs of Truth and Juſtice, from the manage of themſelves before the Court of <hi>Claims,</hi> we have been lately enabled to form an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Herd</hi> and <hi>Hive</hi> of that people, by the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we have made of thoſe few that have flown over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and eſpecially by the little <hi>Colony</hi> which Juſtice <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup</hi> is Governour and Overſeer of. However as I rejoyce at the preſent ſtemming that Deluge of Sin and Miſery which was there ſo nearly threatning innocent and loyal Proteſtants, had not ſome baffle befallen thoſe ſuborned <hi>Affidavit</hi> folk, and did not a notorious infamy attend their teſtimony; ſo I beſeech Almighty God to prevent the conſequences and effects which the countenancing ſuch a courſe, ſhould it again revive and proſper, would in all probability be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and attended with. For as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in that Kingdom do throughly know the humour, principles and inclinations of the Popiſh <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and how abſolutely they are under the conduct, and at the diſpoſal of their Prieſts; ſo by being leſs numerous than the Papiſts, they are both more apprehenſive of, and watchful againſt ruine and danger, and cannot but conſtrue this method of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as much more pernicious than a new War or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in that Barbarous and Bloody people would be.</p>
               <p>But tho the late Sham pretended Proteſtant Plot was ſo laid and contrived by the Papiſts, as to comprehend under the infamy and guilt of it, the chiefeſt perſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> who profeſs the Proteſtant Religion, or have any regard for the Liberties and Rights of Mankind; yet the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and main end of this horrid Papal deſign, was to ruin and deſtroy the Principal Patriots of the Reformation, and civil Liberties in <hi>England.</hi> For upon the Fate of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants here, depends the ſafety or extirpation of all in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199172:28"/> theſe Kingdoms, who profeſs ſeparation from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Proteſtants are not only moſt numerous here, and beſt able to defend themſelves, in caſe a <hi>Maſſacre</hi> ſhould be attempted upon them by the Papiſts, but it was a Parliament in <hi>England</hi> that Voted and Publiſhed the reality of a preſent Popiſh Conſpiracy, that did proclaim to all the world the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which his Majeſty and Loyal Subjects are in, from men of Papal Principles, that cauſed ſome of the principal Conſpirators to be arraigned and condemned, and which hath been endeavouring to hinder a Popiſh Succeſſor from coming hereafter to aſcend the Throne. And therefore, tho' few elſewhere, that are either of any note for zeal to their Religion, or worth ſaving for their ardour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for civil Right, were to eſcape being entangled in the dangers, and loaded with the reproach which they hop'd to bring upon all the Proteſtants of theſe Dominions, by a forged pretence and charge of our being embark'd in a Conſpiracy to depoſe the King, and alter the Government; yet it was mainly the Peers, Gentlemen, and others in <hi>England,</hi> who are reſolved, not only to live and die in the Proteſtant Faith themſelves, but to do all they can to tranſmit it as an inheritance to their poſterity, that this <hi>Sham</hi> was calculated to retch and overthrow. And albeit there have been but few hitherto named and accuſed, yet could the Witneſſes have been but once believed, they would have ſoon ſworn all into the ſame guilt, whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of malice, or for the facilitating the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Popery, and arbitrary power, they had a mind to get deſtroyed. For whatſoever hath been either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in allowed Writings, or affirmed in Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:199172:28"/> that only a few diſcontented, or deſperate perſons, had been deſigning Treaſon againſt His Majeſty; yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in reality quite otherwiſe; and this is only alledged to leſſen the horror of people at firſt, and to prevent the effects of their indignation, ſhould they underſtand the unlimitedneſs of Papal Rage. Nor have the Contrivers and Managers of this <hi>Sham,</hi> been Maſters of ſo much Wit, as to conceal the boundleſneſs of their Wrath, and how exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive they purpoſed to render this <hi>Proteſtant Plot.</hi> For by making <hi>Oxford</hi> the Scene where the King was to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and that at a time when he was ſurrounded with all his Guards, they do plainly tell all the world, that had they obtained the Evidence to be credited and allowed in relation to any one perſon of quality, they would have ſoon brought the Lives and Fortunes of thouſands to lye at their diſcretion and mercy. Admit but once that His Majeſty was to be ſeiſed, when encompaſſed with ſo great and well diſciplined a force, and it will neceſſarily follow, that there muſt have been a very great number of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants engaged for the accompliſhing of it. Nay, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Depoſitions of the Witneſſes themſelves, as they are communicated to the world in Print, in the <hi>Tryal of Mr, Stephen Colledg,</hi> and in the <hi>Proceedings upon the Bill againſt the Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> do ſufficiently proclaim, that there were not only many Proteſtants of an inferior Rank, but many of the principal Peers and Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> that were deſigned to be brought within the circle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of this Proteſtant Plot. Nor is it likely, that having deſigned to bring ſo many under the guilt of the <hi>Sham Meal-Tub</hi> Conſpiracy, they would now abate in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which they purpoſed to deſtroy. For beſides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which they enjoy, through having Counſellers more to their <hi>guſt,</hi> they have either wheedl'd or brib'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199172:29"/> of our high-flown Church-men, if not with a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to glory, yet with an abject ſilence to connive at our ruin. But the bounds which the Papiſts intended to ſet to their own malice, in forging &amp; <hi>ſhamming</hi> upon the world, that the Proteſtants had combined to depoſe the King, may be beſt and moſt eaſily collected from the Teſtimonies of the Witneſſes in the fore-mentioned Treatiſes. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are told by <hi>Dugdale, That</hi> Colledg <hi>not only adviſed him to go with Horſe and Arms to</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>becauſe he expected there would be</hi>

For no man can think, that the blood of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> would have attoned for ſo general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a Conſpiracy, could they but once have enjoyed the good fortune to have had credit given to theſe fellows Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. The deſigns which the Papiſts propoſed unto themſelves, in their forging of this Conſpiracy, were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to be compaſſed and accompliſhed by the murder of Three or Four men in the way of legal proofs. For as nothing leſs was aim'd at by means of this <hi>Sham</hi> Plot, than the deſtroying all who withſtand the Introduction of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the eſtabliſhment of a Popiſh Succeſſor; ſo, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds were to be taken out of the way, beſides thoſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and accuſed, ere ever the people of this Kingdom
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199172:30"/> could be expected quietly to ſubmit to be Papiſts &amp; ſlaves. But becauſe the foregoing Depoſitions do only ſpeak in general of a Conſpiracy wherein the Parliament and Nobles were engaged, in conjunction with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and cut off the King, we ſhall therefore give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, from the Atteſtations of others, of ſome few more, who beſides thoſe publickly named, were to have been charged with, and periſhed under the pretended guilt of this forged Plot. And as we are aſſured from the mouth of a Gentleman of great Reputation and good Quality, that <hi>John Smith</hi> ſaid to him, he could <hi>ſwear Treaſon againſt a hundred Proteſtants;</hi> ſo <hi>Thomas Samſon</hi> hath depoſed upon Oath, That <hi>John Macknamarra told him, that Edward Ivie, Bryan Haynes, John Smith, and Edward Turbervile, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſwear Treaſon againſt Sir</hi> Patience Ward, <hi>Sir</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Clayton, <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Player, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bethel, <hi>who was then Sheriff (of</hi> London), <hi>Coll.</hi> Mildmay, <hi>&amp; others.</hi> Yea, to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence were the mercinary perjured Rogues arrived of their being able to deſtroy men upon the ſuborn'd Teſtimonies that had been dictated unto them, that one Mr. <hi>Shewin</hi> informs upon Oath, <hi>his having heard</hi> John Macknamarra <hi>and</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Turbervil, <hi>offer on the 11th of</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt, to lay a wager, That Mr. Sheriff</hi> Bethel, <hi>Mr.</hi> Beſt, <hi>and divers of the</hi> London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Jury, which had brought in an</hi> Ignoramus <hi>upon the Bill againſt</hi> Stephen Colledg, <hi>would be hang'd before</hi> Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas <hi>laſt.</hi> And that the world may be fully convinced, how the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the Tools of one quality and another, which they work by, deſigned to extend the guilt of this pretended Proteſtant Plot, we ſhall ſubjoyn the Depoſition of one <hi>Aſhlock,</hi> who ſaid, That <hi>Edward Ivie immediately after</hi> Colledg'<hi>s Tryal told him, That as they had gotten the ſaid</hi> Colledg <hi>to be caſt and condemned, ſo they were reſolved to have the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>and other Lords, to drink
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:199172:30"/> of the ſame cup, and to taſte</hi> Colledg'<hi>s fate.</hi> So that no man who is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ought after the knowledg of this, to believe himſelf ſafe, or that he is exempted out of the number of thoſe upon whom the <hi>Papiſts</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot, hoped to have wreck'd their Malice and Rage. For they that dare entertain thoughts of deſtroying a Prince, whom his greateſt Enemies can charge with no fault, ſave that he is a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the King's preſervation and glory, are not to be ſuppoſed to harbour any thoughts of Compaſſion and Mercy towards Proteſtants of an inferior rank. Shall neither the Honour which the D. of <hi>M.</hi> hath brought to His Majeſty and the Nation by his foreign Atchievements, nor the peace and eſtabliſhment which he reſtored to the King and Throne by his prudent and valorous ſubduing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections at home, be ſufficient to protect him from the danger and infamy of a Scaffold, no more than they were able to ſecure him from being excluded his Father and Prince's preſence, and deprived of thoſe Offices which his Merit rendered him worthy of, had he not any nearneſs by Nature and blood to His Majeſty to plead for him? Will nothing ſatisfie the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Crew, unleſs they can bring the King to forget the Affections of Father, as well as the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of a Monarch, and make him abandon a perſon to their treachery and implacable wrath, whom he is obliged by the Laws of nature to protect as his ſon, &amp; whom he is bound by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to defend him as his Subject? And as all men diſcern, whoſe Intereſt hath been ſerved, and whoſe revenge gratified in all the mortifications of this Loyal and Innocent Duke; ſo we can eaſily gueſs, in whoſe behalf, and for the promoting of whoſe concernments this whole Proteſtant Conſpiracy was invented and forged. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſucceeded ſo well already, as by their meer importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:199172:31"/> to alienate his Majeſty from a perſon whom he once ſeemed to value and love, they are encouraged to hope the King will be prevailed with, by ſuggeſtions of Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Crimes, to ſacrifice him to their indignation and ire.</p>
               <p>Having now traced and purſued this forged Plot ſo far, as to ſee that it was calculated for no leſs than the whole Meridian of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and that all the Patriots of Religion and Laws in both Nations were to be deſtroyed under a pretence of being combin'd in it; we are in the next place to view it in the complexion and figure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it opened and unfolded it ſelf againſt the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and thoſe other perſons who have been either Indicted, or only Committed for an alledged acceſſion to it. And as the Papiſts very well know, that none had more oppoſed and diſappointed them in all their Idolatrous and Arbitrary Deſigns, and conſequently deſerved more to feel the firſt and early ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their wrath, than that wiſe and great Peer; ſo they prudently foreſaw, that ſhould they adjourn their Revenge againſt him, till they had made an experience of the credit of their Witneſſes upon ſome other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons, he would by his Abilities and Induſtry not only have eaſily detected and expoſed the whole Intrigue, but have broken the <hi>Machine</hi> by which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected both to overturn Religion and Property, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Proteſtants in theſe Nations. Accordingly they thought it their beſt courſe to aſſault him by way of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and to hurry him to Priſon upon an Accuſation of a Conſpiracy, which people would be aſtoniſhed at the noiſe of, but had not enjoy'd time to inſpect and unravel. And we may rationally conceive the Papiſts believed, that the Convicting My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> upon a charge of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:199172:31"/> War, and Conſpiring to ſeize the Perſon of the King, would be a kind of Moral Proof againſt every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon whom they ſhould think fit to have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards accuſed of the ſame Crime. For how eaſily would they have perſwaded the world, that a perſon of his great Sagacity and exact Conduct, would never embark in ſo vaſt an attempt, without a proportionate number of perſons engaged with him, who for their Power, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Intereſt might be ſuppoſed capable to effect and carry it. And they would have pleaded, that ſuch whom his artificial Gloſſes and plauſible Reaſonings had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled into Treaſon, the eſteem which he univerſally hath among all ſorts of men, that are not weary of their Religion and Liberties, had ſway'd and biaſſed them to an implicite concurrence in a Deſign, which they took not time to conſider, and had not Abilities to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend neither the dangers, nor conſequences and iſſue of. And how would every man have been expoſed and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd, that ſhould offer to bring the reputation of the Witneſſes into ſuſpicion, after they had been allowed for good and credible Evidence againſt a Peer of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s bulk and <hi>figure?</hi> Beſides, the Papiſts thought that the deſtroying this one Nobleman, would have either frighted others to a compliance with them in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, or at leaſt diſcouraged them from offering to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or control the Councels and Projections which they are upon of enſlaving theſe Nations, and extirpating our Religion. Theſe were the Motives and Inducements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they ſingled out this great perſon, to have him the firſt man of Quality that ſhould be Indicted of this pretended <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Conſpiracy. For having through the influence which they have over our Miniſters, and the power which ſome of that party have upon His Majeſty,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:199172:32"/> proceeded ſo far as to prevail with the King to turn him out of his Councels, and from the adminiſtration of his Affairs, for no other reaſon that the world can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, but becauſe he would not concur with them in their Deſigns againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd Laws; they hop'd that by attacquing him at laſt upon an Accuſation of Treaſon, he might fall a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their Malice and Revenge. And as his loſs of the <hi>Chancellorſhip,</hi> with all the aſperſions and obloquy that for divers years fell upon him, are to be aſcribed to his Zeal and Activity in promoting the <hi>Bill</hi> for diſabling <hi>Papiſts</hi> from holding any Publick Employment, which paſt in the <hi>Seſſion</hi> of Parliament that begun <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. 1672. ſo all the Perſeutions he hath lain under of late, and all the dangers which his Life hath been expoſed unto, either by ſecret <hi>Aſſaſſinations,</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> Forms, are to be entirely attributed to his inſpection into the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot, and the endeavours which he hath laid himſelf out in, for preventing the Subverſion of our Religion and Laws, and the ruin of theſe Nations by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Conſpirators, and his ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to defeat the hopes they have of compaſſing all at laſt by means of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor. Nor can there be a more indubitable and convincing Argument, that this whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot under the pretended guilt whereof this incomparable perſon and great Peer was to have been deſtroyed, came out of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Forge, and was formed and invented by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, than that thoſe of the Papal Religin abroad, and eſpecially the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, had both the knowledg of it, and diſcourſed it to others, before the moſt inquiſitive Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> could arrive at any intelligence concerning it. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth whereof, and for the ampler ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all mankind, that the Papiſts were the Authors

Nor is it to be wondered at, that he ſhould become ſubſervient in all baſe ways to the Malice and Indignation of men, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and hopes of a valuable Reward, who that he might obtain preferment to places of Truſt and Profit, is ſaid to have turn'd <hi>Pander</hi> to his own Daughter, and have expoſed her to mens Luſt. But it is long ſince this <hi>Juſtice</hi> was ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of being inſtrumental in the ruin of My Lord <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> ſeing it was he that introduced <hi>Marchiamont Needham</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> in order to aſſiſt in the great Deſigns which were then in agitation againſt this Lord's Honour and Life. And as <hi>Needham</hi> in purſuance of this malicious contrivance, wrote both the <hi>Advices to the men of Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> wherein according to his wonted method of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all he wrote againſt, he loads this Honourable Perſon with all the Aſperſions his Wit, influenced by the Malice and Revenge of others, could invent and ſuggeſt; ſo I have ſeen the Inſtructions that were given about the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning this Peer, upon pretence of his being Guilty of very Criminal matters. But as it is argued, that our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:199172:33"/> then were at a wonderful loſs for Men of Wit and Conduct to promote their Deſigns, while they had ſo many admirably qualified in the want of Honeſty, ſeing they were forced by Money and Flattery, as well as by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which were never perform'd, to bribe over a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to defame this Noble Peer, who had not only always ſcribbled on the other ſide, but reviled the late King, his preſent Majeſty and Monarchical Government, with the like freedom and equal bitterneſs, And ſo ambitious was <hi>Warcup</hi> of being inſtrumental in the ruin of My Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> at that time of day, that not being truſted nor employ'd in the Deſign, proportionably to his deſires and inclinations, he beſpake <hi>Needham</hi> in a Letter to him, which I have ſeen, to recommend him to the Earl of <hi>Dunby,</hi> as a perſon that would be zealous in agitating and promoting what they were upon. And beſides the Evidence that hath been given elſewhere, of Juſtice <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup</hi>'s ſuborning Witneſſes to Swear the forged Conſpiracy, whereof the Earl of<note place="margin">See No Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Plot, part 1. p. 22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> hath been lately accuſed, I ſhall here ſubjoin one further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Villanous carriage in this affair. For Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> among many other things which he hath Depoſed upon Oath before a Magiſtrate in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> poſitively ſwears, <hi>That Juſtice</hi> Warcup <hi>often ſolicited him with promiſes of Reward, to be a Witneſs against the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>and others of the City.</hi> There are alſo other two, whoſe Depoſitions I ſhall forbear at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to reherſe, that directly reſtifie his endeavouring to have Suborn'd them upon the ſame Deſign. So deplorable is the caſe of innocent <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that if perſons accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed do conceal the Witneſſes who can diſcover the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations againſt them, they abandon themſelves and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199172:34"/> their own Innocency; and if they publiſh them, they do become thereby expoſed to the Rage of the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and are brought into danger of being ſuborned againſt themſelves. And therefore the world ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, if we reveal no more than what is neceſſary for the vindication of the Innocency of thoſe that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, and the juſtification of the Integrity of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> that had the cognizance of the Bills which were preſented. The late Proceedings at the Court of the <hi>Verge</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> do declare in the face of all the world, what kind of entertainment they are to expect, who have refuſed to be Witneſſes againſt innocent men, or who have the courage to detect the ſubornations of ſuch as traffick and barter for Evidence againſt guiltleſs Proteſtants. But it is no ways ſtrange, that the <hi>Juſtice</hi> who can muſter a Troop of Mercinary Raſcals to perjure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the ſervice of the Papiſts, ſhould procure ſome of them to venture their Souls upon ſo neceſſary a duty, as the preſerving themſelves and him from the Gibbet, or at the leaſt, the Pillory. Yet even moſt of theſe, whom he then produced, are ſo publickly infamous, that their Teſtimony will never ſupport an Indictment againſt any man, before a good and impartial Jury; nor yet impeach the Credit of the perſon againſt whom they ſwear. I know when and where one of them wrote a Letter to the Juſtice, deſiring him to draw up what he pleaſed, aſſuring him, that upon eaſie conſiderations he would be ready to make Oath of it. Yet after all the pains he hath been at, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect himſelf from the puniſhment of one Crime, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretrating another, he will not only find, that Mr. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> is able to prove that whereof he hath accuſed him, by undeniable Circumſtances, but he will alſo find, there are ſeveral others, whoſe Reputation he can no ways detract
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199172:34"/> from, that will be forth coming in due time and place, to lay open, and prove the Villany whereof he hath been guilty, in ſuborning Witneſſes againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> However, it is no ways fair nor equal, that when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments could not be received, neither at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> nor <hi>Hicks's-Hall,</hi> againſt the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and his Complices, for conſpiring to take away the Lives of innocent perſons, yet a Bill can be immediately admitted in another Court, if the matter and deſign of it be to ſtiflle the detection, or aſperſe the Diſcoverers of this Conſpiracy. Nor is <hi>Warcup</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon that hath been employ'd and intruſted in hiring and ſuborning Witneſſes to ſwear a Proteſtant Plot, but there are many others, and even ſome of the <hi>Gown,</hi> who to gratifie the Papiſts, and either to make way for their own preferment, in caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſor, or to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie their gratitude to ſuch as recommended them to the Places which they do now poſſeſs, have ſhamefully, and to the diſhonour of their Profeſſion, co-operated with the <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the ſame villanous deſign. For beſides their ſecret correſpondence, and myſterious traffick with <hi>Haynes</hi> before his being apprehended, which alone is enough to demonſtrate their concernment in the whole forgery and intrigue of this Proteſtant Plot: There is a perſon, who will appear upon occaſion, that will teſtifie how much a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, retaining to the Law, did endeavour by flattery and promiſes, to obtain him to become a Witneſs againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> It will not at length be found, to have been much to any mans Reputation, to have the gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, managing, or ſetting of the Depoſitions which were brought them by the Maſters of the <hi>Forgery Mint,</hi> but it will for ever ſubject thoſe to a character of Infamy, who contrary to the Juſtice, Equity and Honour of the Law, wherein they are eminent practicers, have proſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199172:35"/> to be Factors for Perjury. And if men will not be brib'd and wheedled to forſwear themſelves upon ſo uſeful and ſacred a deſign, as the deſtroying loyal and harmleſs Proteſtants, who are guilty of no other Crime, but their withſtanding the eſtabliſhment of Popery and Arbitrary Power, they are then hector'd and menaced, and in the Phraſe of our <hi>Engliſh Cicero,</hi> threatned with a new ſort of advancement. Their method is, when they accoſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to inſinuate into, and perſwade him, that he muſt needs know ſomething of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s deſigns againſt His Majeſty; and that if he will be ſo ingenuous as to confeſs, he hath an opportunity preſented him, both of enriching himſelf, and obtaining the favour of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But then in caſe the party aſſaulted, prove ſo juſt to himſelf, and the perſon whom they would <hi>decoy</hi> and Wire-draw him to accuſe, as to tell them, he is altogether ignorant of any ill deſign projected or promoted by that Noble Peer, he is in the next place told, that they have an Information of a dangerous Nature againſt him; and that ſeeing by declining to inform againſt my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> he makes himſelf unworthy of the Favour and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Prince, he muſt therefore expect to feel the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and ſeverity of the Law. This was the courſe that was ſteered towards Captain <hi>Wilkinſon;</hi> and this was the way wherein Sir <hi>Richard Graham,</hi> late High Sheriff of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and Sir <hi>Jonathan Jennings,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Rippon,</hi> uſed towards <hi>William Brownrigg.</hi> And as all the Nation is ſufficiently made acquainted with, and is fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of what Captain <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> for declining to be a falſe Witneſ, became expoſed unto, ſo I ſhall here ſubjoin the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> by which <hi>Brownrigg,</hi> upon his refuſing to come in as an Evidence againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was ſent Priſoner by Sir <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to <hi>York</hi> Caſtle, upon a pretence,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199172:35"/> that there was an Information of Treaſon againſt him, and that it was no more but a pretence, or what is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, a falſe Information, appears from their diſcharging him ſometime after without any proſecution.</p>

Upon the whole it plainly appears, that this pretended Proteſtant Plot, which the Nation hath been ſo alarm'd with, and filled with the noiſe of, is nothing but a mere Invention of the Papiſts, and of ſome ill men, who under the diſguiſe of being for the Crown and the Church, ſerve and promote their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wicked Deſigns; and that the combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Religion, Laws, Lives and Liberties, is as

                  <hi>matter that is treaſonable, ſworn before them by Two Witneſſes that are</hi> prima fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie credibil (where by the way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>prima facie credibil,</hi> be in the Print, yet it is not in the Manuſcripts which we have had the fortune and opportunity to conſult.) I ſay notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that we are told thus by the Judges, yet we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our ſelves juſtified both by the Law of the Land, and the common Reaſon oſ Mankind, in taking upon us to affirm, that no man is to have his Name, Reputation and Honour upon a <hi>Preſentment</hi> detracted from, much leſs his Loyalty to his Prince Impeached upon an <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and thereby his Life and Eſtate brought into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:199172:36"/> ſave upon the Evidence of perſons of good Credit and moral Fame. The very words of the Statute of the 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. upon which my Lord Chief-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That the Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>was principally founded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not only contains the Treaſons declared in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the 25th of</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>but enlargeth them in many particulars;</hi> I ſay that very Statute requires, that <hi>the Witneſſes be lawful and credible.</hi> Beſides it is a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that a perſon ſhould be ſuppoſed <hi>credible,</hi> who either never had or hath forfeited his <hi>credit.</hi> No man is capable of proving a Crime <hi>Legally,</hi> but he that is reputed <hi>Morally</hi> honeſt. All Hiſtories, as well <hi>Sacred</hi> as <hi>Prophane,</hi> tell us, How men of depraved Principles, being influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by thoſe in Power, or bribed and hired by Rewards, have conſpired to Swear againſt the Innocent. Thus was <hi>Naboth</hi> murdered at the inſtigation of the Court, upon the Teſtimony of perjured and ſuborned Witneſſes. And as his Crime was his ſtanding for his Legal Right, and not ſurrendring his Property and Inheritance to the <hi>Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> pleaſure of the Prince; ſo he was both Tried and Condemned in the way of a Legal <hi>Form.</hi> Nor ought it to appear ſtrange, to find a guiltleſs perſon Accuſed by falſe Witneſſes of Treaſon, ſeing the Holy and Innocent <hi>Jeſus</hi> was Indicted and Murdered for no leſs Crime, and that by the mouths of two Witneſſes, of the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and ſtamp with ours, and procured in the ſame way. Whoever hath read <hi>Tacitus</hi> or <hi>Suetonius,</hi> will be ſupplied with Inſtances enough, of the ſlaughter of the chiefeſt Patriots of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Depoſitions of falſe Witneſſes, ſet on and authoriſed by the commands of Soveraigns, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Rewards from the State. Yea, ſo prevalent are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:199172:37"/> Malice and Revenge in ſome, Pride, Envy and Emulation in others, and the love of Profit and Gain in many, that neither the moſt provident and ſevere Laws to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nor the Wiſdom and Circumſpection of the beſt and moſt prudent Adminiſtrators of publick Juſtice, have been able at all times to prevent the ruin of the moſt uſeful, eminent and innocent perſons, but they have periſhed under the falſe Accuſations and groundleſs Calumnies of perjured and wicked Raſcals. Thus <hi>Anthonio Foſcarini,</hi> a Cavalier and Senator of <hi>Venice,</hi> was <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. ſeen hanged upon a Gallows upon the Teſtimony of infamous perſons, whereof ſome turning Accuſers, and others Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they deſtroyed a <hi>Patrician</hi> of great Merit and Vertue, and brought an aſperſion upon the Juſtice of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate. But this<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Nani's <hi>Hist. lib. 5. p. 180.</hi>
                  </note> ought to be added for the Honour of that Republick, that aſſoon as they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Conſpiracy, under the fraud and villany whereof he fell, they not only inflicted a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable puniſhment upon the principal Authors and Inſtruments of his Murder; but by a publick Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they both reſtored unto him an honourable Name, and to his Poſterity the antient luſtre of his Family, with an advancement to further degrees of Honour in the Commonwealth. And tho' we hope that God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Patriots of our Religion and Liberties from periſhing through the Combination of ſuborned and profligate Wretches, as this unfortunate <hi>Patrician</hi> did; yet we expect from the Juſtice of His Majeſty and the Government, that having a more wicked, large and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Conſpiracy againſt innocent perſons detected unto them, they will not think it unbecoming the Glory of a Monarchy, to imitate a Republick in all the meaſures
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:199172:37"/> of Equity and Righteouſneſs, as well towards the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly accuſed, as the infamous Accuſers.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, No mans life were ſecure, provided the Witneſſes would but ſwear things heinous, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and boldneſs, if a Jury were not to judg of their Credibility and Fame. Not only our Laws, but the Laws of all Nations declare ſome ſort of men infamous; and Principles of Natural Light, and Converſe among men, inſtruct us to ſuſpend giving credit to divers, whom the Laws have not branded with that ignominious character. And a perſons being Morally flagitious, tho' he be not in a Legal ſenſe infamous, may render his Teſtimony juſtly ſuſpected; becauſe he hath abandoned all Principles which may reſtrain him from ſpeaking falſely. What a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing were it to require Grand Juries to uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means of diſcovering whether Indictments and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments be true or falſe, if they are not to judg of the Credibility of the Witneſſes, upon whoſe Teſtimony they are to give their Judgment and Opinion? Were it not an unjuſt as well as incongruous thing, to make all Grand Jury-men ſwear, <hi>They ſhall preſent nothing but the Truth, and the whole Truth,</hi> if they be not to enquire how far the Oaths of the Witneſſes, upon which their <hi>Verdict</hi> depends, ought to be believed, ſeing there are ſome, that <hi>Ne jurantibus creditur.</hi> Now as to the Witneſſes that Swear a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot, there are in general theſe Three Things to Impeach the Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their Teſtimony. Firſt, They are remarkably Profane and Flagitious; and we uſually ſay, that <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia cum ſcelerato non poteſt habere comercium,</hi> Truth and Righteouſneſs have no place, where Ungodlineſs and Villany bear ſway and reign. They perjure themſelves every day over and over out of Wantonneſs; and is it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:199172:38"/> not then probable, that they will forſwear themſelves for profit, eſpecially if they may be protected from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which they become liable unto, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. Nor do I know any thing that ſhould check or reſtrain them; for as they live dreadleſs of God and Hell, ſo they imagine that the Intereſt and Power of the party, whoſe Deſigns they promote in ſwearing a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Plot,</hi> will be able to defend them from the Gallows and Halter. Their Debaucheries are ſo ſignal, beyond thoſe of other men, that whereſoever they come, they are known without enquiry to be the <hi>New Evidence</hi> by their exceſſive Debaucheries. Their declining to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Queſtions put unto them by the Jury, as ſuppoſing that by their reply, they may bring themſelves under a Subjection to puniſhment, is demonſtrative to all the World how infamous Raſcals they are, and how little they ought to be credited. In the ſecond place, They are all of them of a narrow fortune, and moſt of them miſerably indigent. It was their daily complaint a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they became Evidence to prove a <hi>Proteſtant Plot,</hi> that they were ready to ſtarve, and wanted bread. The <hi>Civil Law</hi> tells us, that <hi>vili perſonae non facile creditur; We are not eaſily to give credit to a penurious perſon.</hi> And as all Nations take notice, that the Teſtimony of neceſſitous perſons, ought not to bear much ſway with any man; ſo ſome Governments have taken care, that ſuch who have not a competency to raiſe them above the Temptations of Hunger and Want, ſhall not in any Caſe that is Criminal, be allowed to be Witneſſes. The Poet tells us, that <hi>Quantum nummorum quiſque habet in arca, tantum habet &amp; fidei;</hi> that is, he who cannot live without being behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, ought not to be admitted to have a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſupport what he ſays in a Caſe that is Important,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:199172:38"/> and where he may reap conſiderable advantage by his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. <hi>Agur</hi> knew what Temptations there were in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury, and therefore prayed, <hi>That he might not be poor, leſt he ſhould take the Name of the Lord in vain.</hi> And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Goals</hi> for Witneſſes, is an undeniable Argument, that there is little Reality or Truſt in that which they are produced for. Nor is it improbable, but that theſe Raſcals finding themſelves diſappointed both of Penſions from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and Contributions from the <hi>City,</hi> and having nothing of their own whereby to purchaſe food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they thereupon bethought themſelves of ſetting their ſouls to Merchandiſe making a Subſiſtance by the ſale of their Conſciencies. When they perceived, that by all their Importunities and Petitions, they could not ſqueez Mony out of our Pockets, they took up a Reſolution in anger and revenge to drink our Blood. Men that are neceſſitous, and withal<note place="margin">See no Proteſt. Plot. part 1. p. 26. and part 2. p. 10, 11.</note> wicked, will undertake to perjure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a thouſand times over, provided they may be put into a Condition of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in plenty and eaſe. But this having been ſuggeſted and inſiſted upon elſewhere, I ſhall content my ſelf to have here briefly intimated it. Thirdly, They were the moſt unlikely of all men alive, to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe things they ſwore about. No man who is not forſaken of his Reaſon, would ever believe that they who had diſcovered the Deſigns of their own Party, notwithſtanding the Oathes of Secrecy which they were under, ſhould conceal a Conſpiracy of ours. For the ſame inducements that led them to diſcover the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> muſt in all mens apprehenſions, much more influence them to reveal a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> one. Is it not enough, that the Authors and Managers of this <hi>Intrigue,</hi> would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:199172:39"/> to be Traytors, but they muſt proclaim us arrant Fools? Inſtead of endeavouring to hang us, as Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors againſt the King, they ought to beg us as <hi>Naturals;</hi> and inſtead of ſending us to the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>Newgate,</hi> they ſhould ſend us to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> as the moſt proper place. If we be ſo ſilly as they repreſent us, we ought not to be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but to have Phyſick preſcribed unto us. And this Affair is not ſo fit for the <hi>Council Table,</hi> and a Bench of <hi>Judges,</hi> as for a Colledge of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and a Company of <hi>Apothecaries.</hi> Whoſoever conſiders theſe fellows either with reſpect to their <hi>Morals,</hi> or their <hi>Politicks;</hi> or takes a view either of their Natural or their Civil Capacity, will eaſily conclude, that none but men wholly bereft of their Wits would entruſt them with the knowledge of a Deſign which they were in no Condition to further; and which rationally they muſt be conceived inclinable to betray. And if we ſhould believe that perſons who are neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of former times, nor have themſelves been converſant in any weighty Counſels, crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs, ſhould be guilty of ſuch a folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet no man can believe ſuch a thing of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> whom whatſoever his Enemies think, or ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of him, yet they do all acknowledge him to be a perſon of great Wiſdom, Circumſpection and Conduct. When perſons of a low Condition, and of ſuch proffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Lives, as the witneſſes are known to be, will pretend not only familiar acceſs at all times to a perſon of high quality, but their being upon the moſt weighty and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareous Secrets of one of the wiſeſt of men, it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that all they ſay, is Romance and Fiction.</p>
               <p>Surely if there had been any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending and depoſing of the King, either thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> would have known
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:199172:39"/> of it; but as the latter do abſolutely deny, that ever they either had the leaſt acceſs to ſuch a deſign, or were any ways made acquainted with, ſo even thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who ſeem moſt forward, out of hatred to Diſſenters, to believe a <hi>Proteſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,</hi> yet they are not able, after all<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> No Proteſtant Plot, <hi>part 1. p. 10.</hi>
                  </note> their enquiries concerning it, and the great noiſe and clamour they have made about it, to arrive at any prints or foot-ſteps of it. There is this to evidence the truth and reality of a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> That it was detected both by Laicks and Prieſts of their own Communion; whereas the firſt and principal Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of this pretended Proteſtant Combination againſt His Majeſty and the Monarchy, lately were, and may ſtill be ſuſpected to be Members of the Papal Church.</p>
               <p>But what we have ſaid againſt the Credibility of the Witneſſes in general, is nothing in compariſon of what we have to alledg againſt every one of them in particular. And we ſhall take them in the ſame order, in our expoſing of them, as they were rank'd and brought forth by the <hi>Heranlds,</hi> who beſt knew their Quality, at the <hi>Old Baily.</hi> And foraſmuch as Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> was produced firſt, we ſhall accordingly begin with him. Tho' indeed to produce him at all, and eſpecially in the firſt place, was no leſs than to diſcredit the Teſtimony of all the reſt, had they been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of much better Reputation than they were. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the many Reflections which I have often made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proceedings of that day, and the manage of them, I cannot but think, that either the Council, for opening, diſpoſing and applying of the Evidence, were ſtrangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated, or that they never intended the Jury ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one word that was depoſed and ſworn before them; otherwiſe they would never have begun with the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:199172:40"/> of ſo infamous a fellow. This <hi>Booth</hi> hath been guilty of, and publickly branded vvith all ſort of Crimes and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies. Having of a <hi>Serving man</hi> or <hi>Steward,</hi> commenced <hi>Parſon,</hi> he vvas juſtly ſuſpended from the exerciſe of the Miniſtry, and vvithal turned out of his living, not only for <hi>Symony,</hi> but for <hi>Debauchery.</hi> He hath been alſo Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and Convicted for Clipping and Coining; and had not His Majeſty, upon the importunity of ſome perſons about him, vouchſafed him a Pardon, the <hi>Papists</hi> vvould have been prevented of this Witneſs againſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for the Rogue had been hang'd long ago. Can any man think, that he is a credible Witneſs, to prove the beſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and chiefeſt men of Quality of <hi>England,</hi> guilty of Treaſon, who had been condemned himſelf, as a Traitor for a crime of the baſeſt and moſt ignominious kind. I knovv that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don may reſtore a perſon to be a Witneſs in Lavv; but after one hath been Convicted for Crimes ſo prejudicial to States and Societies, as Coining and Clipping are, and vvhich none are found guilty of, or liable unto, but Villains of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Principles and moſt degenerate Natures, it cannot be ſuppoſed, that a Pardon vvill ever give them a fair Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the World, or reſtore them to any conſiderable Credit amongſt men; but that notwithſtanding their being pardon'd, they will be always lookt upon as fellows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to be eaſily corrupted, and ready to embark in any ill deſign. Yea, beſides his being Convicted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Treaſon, he hath been alſo Indicted for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and tho' he came off, yet all who were preſent at the Tryal ſay, The preſumption was great, and accordingly preſerve in their minds a ſuſpicion of his guilt. For the matter, as it appeared againſt him, lay thus; namely, That a certain boy having had occaſion to know divers of his wicked and criminal practices, <hi>Booth</hi> thereupon became ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:199172:40"/> that the lad by diſcovering them, might bring him to the puniſhments which he knew he deſerved; and therefore having ſet the youth upon a Horſe, he drove him into a River, and purſu'd him to and fro, till he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and drowned. The poſitive ſwearing of a Varlet, upon whom the preſumption of ſo horrid a guilt does lye, cannot in the judgment of all impartial men, ſo much as faſten a Reproach, much leſs ſupport an Accuſation of Treaſon againſt any perſon. Nor will it in the iſſue turn to the honour of any, that they have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Life of a great Peer, upon the Teſtimony of this profligate wretch. I might add to thoſe Crimes whereof he hath been Charged and Arraigned at Bars, his having paſſed under a ſuſpicion, and undergone Accuſations of poyſoning not only a Gentleman's Horſe, whoſe Company upon the Road, the deſigns which he had then in hand, made him deſirous to eſcape and avoid, but of poyſoning a young Maid or Girl, from whoſe death he expected an advantage. But there needs no more to blaſt the Credit of this wretch, with all that are either wiſe or honeſt, ſave his endeavouring firſt to ſuborn Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> to ſwear falſely againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and then depoſing Treaſon againſt the <hi>Captain,</hi> for not complying in ſo wicked a deſign. And for a Jury to believe ſuch a profligate Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal's Affidavit, were both to bring upon themſelves the guilt of innocent blood, and betray their own and other mens Lives into his hands, whenſoever it may be profitable to him to ſwear Treaſon againſt them. Upon the whole, As my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> had ſome weighty Reaſons, why he would not allow the Jury to ask Mr. <hi>Booth, Whether ever he had been Indicted for Fellony,</hi> ſo the Jury had ſufficient Reaſons from common Fame, and the Informations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as juſt grounds of ſuſpicion from my <hi>Lord's</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:199172:41"/> Inhibition, and the Fellow's avoiding to anſwer, to believe that he had, and conſequently to judg, what little Credit was to be given to his Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The next perſon who appeared upon the Stage at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> upon the preferment of the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was Mr. <hi>Turberville;</hi> and accordingly we ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie the world, that his Depoſitions againſt this Noble Peer ought to be no ways believed or regarded. I love to tread ſoftly upon the grave of the dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not diſcover the groſs immoralities of his Life; I mean, ſuch as detract from the Reputation of a man's Word and Oath. For being delivered from his malice, I ſhall not load his Memory, more than the being juſt to our ſelves, and the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> party in this Kingdom, makes indiſpenſably neceſſary. Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> depoſeth upon Oath, That he and Mr. <hi>Turberville</hi> being together, at the Sign of the <hi>Cock,</hi> by the <hi>Pall Mall,</hi> Two or Three days before <hi>Colledg</hi>'s Tryal, Mr. <hi>Turberville</hi> told him <hi>of a deſign that was on foot againſt Proteſtants; but ſwore, That he knew nothing againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>the Lord</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, <hi>or any other Proteſtants, ſave only of</hi> Colledg'<hi>s idle words, and</hi> Rous'<hi>s keeping back the charity of the City from the Evidence. William Clerk,</hi> Eſq; informeth likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, <hi>That upon the 5th of</hi> July <hi>he went to ſee Mr.</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berville; <hi>and having found him in a houſe in</hi> Lincolns-Inn-Fields, <hi>in bed, he told him; That he had heard by Sir</hi> Allen Apſley, <hi>how he, the ſaid</hi> Turberville, <hi>had given Evidence againſt my Lord of</hi> Shaftsbury; <hi>and that</hi> Turberville <hi>repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, He would meet Sir</hi> Allen <hi>any where but at his own houſe, and would juſtifie, that he was never in Town ſince my Lord</hi> Stafford'<hi>s Tryal; and that he never gave Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>neither did he know any thing againſt him.</hi> Nay, there are many other perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:199172:41"/> ſuch as Sir <hi>Francis Rolls, William Herbert,</hi> Eſquire,—<hi>Hobbs,</hi> Eſquire, <hi>John Trenchard,</hi> Eſquire, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of great Honour and Truth, who do all teſtifie, That after the Commitment of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Turberville declared the ſame to them with many ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, That he neither was, nor could be a Witneſs againſt this Noble Peer.</hi> So that the Grand Jury, before whom the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was preferred, had juſt ground for the queſtion which they put to the ſaid <hi>Turberville;</hi> viz. <hi>Whether, having been challenged by ſome, after my Lord's Commitment, concerning his being a Witneſs againſt him, he had not proteſted before God, and ſworn deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he knew nothing againſt my Lord.</hi> And all men of Judgment and Senſe, are wonderfully ſurpriſed, both at the <hi>Attorney General's</hi> objecting, <hi>That they were not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ask ſuch a question,</hi> and at my L. C. J. inſinuating, <hi>That this was no ground to cavil with the Witneſſes upon:</hi> (for ſo, according to our Manuſcript, tho' it be in gentler terms in the Print, he was pleaſed to expreſs it). For as a Jury are to take equal care to defend the Lives and Reputations of the innocent, as to convict ſuchas are criminal and guilty; ſo they are obliged to take notice of every thing which lies in a ſubſerviency to the diſcovery of the Truth, which way ſoever it arrives with them, whether it be upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick fame, or by the information of particular perſons. Seing therefore it plainly appears, that what <hi>Turberville</hi> ſaid in the <hi>Court,</hi> was contradictory to what he had declared to divers perſons <hi>elſewhere;</hi> and that his Oath at the <hi>Bar,</hi> was directly repugnant to what he had ſworn before divers Gentlemen in <hi>other places,</hi> we may very reaſonably conclude, that his whole Depoſitions againſt my <hi>Lord,</hi> were either the invention of this perjur'd fellow, or that they were dictated unto him by ſuch who had hired and ſuborned him to come
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199172:42"/> in as an Evidence, in order to deſtroy this honourable Peer. But this is not all that we have to offer againſt the <hi>credibility</hi> of this Witneſs; for beſides this, we have the Teſtimonies of ſeveral honeſt and reputable perſons, of his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had been often tempted to go off from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and to come in, and depoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For not only Mr. <hi>Broadgate</hi> ſwears, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Turberville <hi>told him, that he had great proffers of preferment and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Colledg</hi>'s Tryal, p. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>rewards from the Court, if he would go off from what he had ſaid, and come upon the contrary,</hi> but Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> affirms, That the ſaid <hi>Turberville</hi> declared unto him, how Mr. <hi>Warcup had offered him any thing</hi>

                  <hi>he would deſire, provided he would ſwear againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>my Lord</hi> Howard, <hi>Mr.</hi> Rous <hi>and Mr.</hi> Whitaker. Yea, his being one of thoſe that ſubſcribed the Petition to my <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Common-Council aſſembled,</hi> wherein they declare, <hi>That the Papiſts had not only ſo far wrought upon the neceſſities of ſome, as that for a preſent ſupply, they had Ship-wrack'd their conſciences, but that they were tampering with, and labouring to corrupt others of the moſt conſiderable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> I ſay his being one that ſubſcribed that Petition, is enough to aſſure all unbiaſſed perſons, how and upon what Motives and Terms he came to be an Evidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot. And whereas he had the Impudence to affirm in Court,<note place="margin">See the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> p. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>That tho he ſigned that Petition, yet he never read it, nor knew what was in it;</hi> I ſhall here ſubjoin an Information of Mr. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy,</hi> the Scrivener who drew it, which being directly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:199172:42"/> to the contrary, may ſerve both to overthrow this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs evaſion, and convince the world what a lying infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Raſcal this <hi>Turberville</hi> was. Now the Information which Mr. <hi>Beliamy</hi> hath both given under his hand, and declares himſelf ready to Depoſe upon Oath, whenſoever he ſhall be called thereunto, is in the words following; namely, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Turberville, Macknamarra, Haynes <hi>and others came to his houſe (being near</hi> Guild-hal) <hi>the Night before the Common-Council ſate, to deſire him to draw a Petition to the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, for their preſent ſupport and maintenance. And that when they had given him Inſtructions, he drew a foul draught thereof, which he read to them the next Morning, as audibly and diſtinctly as he could; and that they all ſeemed very well ſatisfied with it, deſiring only that he would add to the laſt clauſe of the body of the Petition theſe words,</hi> viz. That they could not be ſupplied out of His Majeſties Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. <hi>And that when he had thus perfected the foul draught to their ſatisfaction, and ingroſſed it, he read it to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the ſame plainneſs and distinctneſs as before; and that all of them did very well approve of it, eſpecially Mr.</hi> Turberville, <hi>who was pleaſed to give it a particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> Now whether we ought to believe Mr. <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> who ſwears <hi>That he never read that Petition, nor knew what was in it; but that it was drawn by the order of Mr.</hi> Colledg, or believe Mr <hi>Bellamy,</hi> who affirms and is ready to depoſe upon Oath, That <hi>Turberville</hi> and the reſt gave Inſtructions for the drawing of it, ordered the foul draught to be corrected by the addition of ſeveral impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant words, had it read to them diſtinctly and audibly, and gave their approbation of it; I ſhall refer it to the judgment of all ſober, diſcreet and unbiaſſed men. Nor is it unworthy of our obſervation, that when the ſame
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199172:43"/> Petition was objected againſt him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> towards the invalidating his Teſtimony againſt Mr. <hi>Colledg,</hi> he was provided with no ſuch anſwer as this, which he retreated to at the <hi>Old-Baily;</hi> which forced My Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>North</hi> to endeavour to relieve him, by ſaying, <hi>There was nothing in that Petition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>that is a Contradiction to what he then Swore.</hi> But I humbly conceive all men will not be of this <hi>Reverend Judges</hi> mind, eſpecially when they conſider that <hi>Turbervile</hi> and the reſt whoſe hands are to that Petition, do not only therein declare how reſtleſs the <hi>Papists</hi> were in tampering with the Witneſſes to corrupt them to ſtifle and diſcredit the belief of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> but that they were labouring to obtain them to impute the ſame unto, and devolve it upon <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi> And for the ſhift which <hi>Turberville</hi> hath ſince betaken himſelf unto, it is nothing but an evaſion, either lately invented by himſelf, or ſuggeſted unto him by thoſe that Suborned him. And yet the Sillineſs of it is as conſpicuous as the Falſhood. For as it is incredible that any man ſhould ſet his hand to a Paper, which he had neither read, nor knew what was in it; ſo no man that ſhould draw ſuch a Petition, provided he were wiſe, would admit it, ſeing it might give thoſe very perſons, at whoſe deſire he had done it, an advantage of turning upon him, to his prejudice. The whole ground and foundation upon which <hi>Turbervile</hi> came to Swear a <hi>Protestant Plot,</hi> are laid open<note place="margin">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:199172:43"/> Citizens had deſerted him, and God damn him he would not ſtarve.</hi> Alas! We poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thought our ſelves ſafe in our Innocency, but behold a company of indigent and mercinary Raſcals have reſolved to Swear us into Guilt, that they might obtain Bread. Upon the whole it doth appear, that the Teſtimony of <hi>Turberville</hi> ought to be eſteemed of no validity: And that the <hi>Jury</hi> could not in the caſe of my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> do otherwiſe than they did, notwithſtanding the Teſtimony of this Fellow, without becoming themſelves unrighteous and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>The next perſon that mounted as an <hi>Affidavit</hi>-man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon every way adapted to compenſate the deficiency of truth in what he ſays, with impudence in the manner of declaring it. And becauſe ſome who do not throughly know the man, ſeek more eſpecially to countenance the belief of a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot from his Teſtimony, we ſhall be the more careful to unmask him, and give the world a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of him in his juſt features, complexion and colours. What truely his Chriſtian <hi>Name</hi> is, or whether he have any or no, I cannot certainly tell; but I have made a ſhift of late to learn both his <hi>Sirname</hi> and his <hi>Country;</hi> namely that the one is <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the other <hi>Barry.</hi> And ſeeing that<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See procedings againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, p. 69.</note> he was not brought to acknowledg the name of <hi>Barry,</hi> but after ſome tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; I do affirm, that that is the only name he ought to go by, if it were not the temper, humour and intereſt of the man to walk always in a diſguiſe. And foraſmuch as he hath been ambitious to ſeek a Reputation by pretending himſelf an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, I do proclaim to all the world, that he was born in <hi>Connaught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:199172:44"/> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 'Tis ſo habitual for ſome to lie, that no ties nor obligations can make them ſpeak truth. However, he hath not ſo much diſhonoured <hi>England,</hi> by pretending himſelf a Native here, as he hath our <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> by giving himſelf out for a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> For whereas <hi>England</hi> owns many Villains and flagitious perſons for Natural Subjects and free <hi>Deniſons, Chriſt</hi> will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg none for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that only make mention of his Name, when they blaſpheme it. But if the world will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that ſwears as often as he ſpeaks, I ſay, that in all probability, notwithſtanding whatſoever he pretends to the contrary, he is truly and really a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> hath depoſed upon Oath, <hi>That</hi> John Smith, Stephen Dugdale <hi>and</hi> Edward Turberville, <hi>having ſent for him to the One Tun Tavern in</hi> Hungerford <hi>Market, on the 23d of</hi> September <hi>laſt,</hi> Smith <hi>begun the Duke of</hi> York'<hi>s Health, ſwearing, God damn him, that he therefore both lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and drunk his Health becauſe he was a</hi> Papiſt. I am ſo far from being angry at his drinking the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi>'s Health, that out of ſincere love to His Majeſty, as well as the Proteſtant Religion, I wiſh no man may ever have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to drink it under a higher Title. All that I would obſerve is, upon what motive and inducement <hi>Barry</hi>'s love to his Royal Highneſs is grounded and built. To this I ſhall only ſubjoin one proof more, of what Religion, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pretends, we ought to eſteem him to be; namely, that he ſaid at <hi>Newark,</hi> He would ſooner hang Ten <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> than One <hi>Papiſt.</hi> And his Reaſon was as conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as his Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Popiſh <hi>principles led them to Treaſon, which the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>principles did not.</hi> It would ſeem, the fellow begun to apprehend, that the Court would grow weary of his confidence and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and therefore he begins to commend principles which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:199172:44"/> may juſtifie his being another <hi>Jaques Clement,</hi> or a new <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiack.</hi> And if he anſwer the Character I have received of him, there is not a perſon alive, who is more likely to ſupply the place, and undertake the Province of the <hi>Four Ruffians,</hi> who were diſappointed and prevented in their deſign againſt his Majeſty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1678. than this lean, long chapp'd <hi>Caſſius</hi> featured fellow is; and the rather, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the Crimes againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> which he contracted, by pretending to be the Author of a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which, ſave the Depoſition, was none of his own. But to make a nearer approach to the Credibility (and that I may uſurp a modern Phraſe), the <hi>Veracity</hi> of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, there are no fewer than an hundred Witneſſes, who can teſtifie, how he uſually reproached the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence, alledging, that their Credit was ſo mean, that it would not ſuſtain the Depoſitions which they had given concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Popiſh Plot; and that all of them were ſuch Mercinary Raſcals, as would be induced, and were in a fair way of being prevailed upon to ſwear, that there was a Conſpiracy wherein Proteſtants were engag'd againſt the Government.

Nay, the very day that <hi>Everard</hi> and he were called as Witneſſes upon the Bill againſt my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he told Mr. <hi>Wilmore,</hi> calling God to witneſs to the truth of what he ſaid, <hi>That he knew no harm by my Lord</hi> Howard, <hi>nor by any Proteſtant in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>and that he knew no Reaſon, why he and Mr.</hi> Everard <hi>ſhould be ſubpoena'd, unleſs it were to gloſs the buſineſs, and make Mrs.</hi> Fitz Harris'<hi>s and her Maid's Teſtimony go down

                  <hi>concerned in a Plot, only that</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>had ſpoken ſuch and ſuch words, which for his part he did not believe to be true.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Monday</hi> before the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was Committed, he ſent for a Gentleman, who when there is a juſt occaſion, will be ready to teſtifie it upon Oath; and the Gentleman having met him according to his deſire, he not only told him, there was Treaſon ſworn againſt that Noble Peer, and by whom, but that a certain Lord in the other end of the Town, had been dealing with him to ſwear likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Withal, he further added, that he replied to that Lord, and ſaid, He thought he knew the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buoy</hi> as well, and had as much Credit with him, as thoſe whom his Lordſhip had named for Witneſſes againſt him, and yet he had never heard him ſay any thing that was Treaſonable, nor what had a tendency that way. And this he deſired to have communicated to my Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> that night, ſaying, it was his intereſt to know it as ſoon as might be, ſeeing there was a great deſign againſt his Life. And yet after all theſe Declarations, made at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199172:45"/> times, and to different perſons, this impudent and frontleſs fellow, hath not been aſhamed to appear on the publick Stage, and accuſe this Honourable Peer of moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Treaſons. Nor is it difficult to conceive, how this came about: for being a man of no Conſcience, and ambitious of Preferment, he was eaſily perſwaded by Juſtice <hi>Warcup,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe of a <hi>Deanry,</hi> to undertake the accuſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of a Conſpiracy againſt his Majeſties Perſon and the eſtabliſhed Government. He had been often complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was neither ſo much regarded at Court, nor rewarded by the Parliament and Kingdom, as he thought he deſerved, and had impatiently expected, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which he gave of the Popiſh Plot. And therefore being accoſted by <hi>Warcup,</hi> with promiſes of preferment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he could hope for by adhering to his Evidence againſt the Papiſts, he readily complied with the <hi>Juſtice</hi>'s importunity, and comenceth a Witneſs on the gainful ſide. This plainly appears by the information which Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> hath given; namely, <hi>That the Dr. having askt</hi> Smith, <hi>what he had been at</hi> Windſor <hi>about?</hi> Smith, <hi>by way of reply, told him, he had been there about a deſign which he ſuppoſed the Dr. would be glad to come into; and that he might not only learn it of</hi> Warcup, <hi>but be happy, if he followed his advice therein.</hi> Accordingly, the Dr. being curious to know what this great project, which would render a man happy, ſhould be, he addreſſed himſelf to the Juſtice, who told him, <hi>That there was a deſign to take off my Lord of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and that he had brought over</hi> Smith, <hi>and ſeveral others to accuſe him, and ſwear a Proteſtant Plot.</hi> And if the deſign againſt the Lives of Proteſtants, were to be carried by poſitive Swearing, there is not a Knight of the <hi>Poſt</hi> in <hi>England</hi> that can parallel <hi>Smith</hi> in a bold and daring <hi>Affidavit.</hi> For he that hath ſo far abandoned all Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:199172:46"/> and renounced all Fear, as not to forbear to ſay, <hi>That if he pleaſed, he could</hi>

                  <hi>prove God Almighty a fool;</hi> will never be ſtartled at Swearing an Innocent and Loyal perſon, <hi>a Rebel and Traitor.</hi> And he that that is ſo dreadleſs of the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Chriſt, as to bid <hi>God damn the Goſpel,</hi> will eaſily diſpenſe with murdering the guiltleſs. It is not improbable, but that the fellow being originally an <hi>Iriſh papiſt,</hi> was nurſed with the Blood of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and that therefore he ſtill thirſts after it, as his natural and <hi>genial</hi> drink. He knows how to compenſate the want of truth in the matter he is to ſwear about, by impudence in the manner of declaring what he ſwears unto. And could he have been but once believed by a Jury, there would no man have been ſafe, whom he either hated, or whom his ſupreme Directors were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have taken out of the way. For there is one Mr. <hi>Shewin</hi> Depoſeth that he heard him ſay, <hi>That had he but the knowledg of Mr.</hi> Jenks <hi>and ſeveral others who had traduced him, he would make examples of them, and not fail to Swear that againſt them, that ſhould take them off.</hi> And there is a Gentleman of unqueſtionable reputation, who affirms he heard <hi>Smith</hi> ſay, <hi>He could ſwear Treaſon againſt an hundred. Proteſtants, had he but other Witneſſes to join with him.</hi> Nor did <hi>Smith</hi> think it enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to perjure himſelf in order to deſtroy <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but he hath turned Suborner of others to do the ſame. And I ſuppoſe I may lawfully and fairly mention <hi>Balron</hi>'s Depoſition to that purpoſe. For tho' he be a profligate Villain himſelf, yet he may be a good Witneſs againſt his Complices, and eſpecially ſuch as debauched him into
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:199172:46"/> Perjury. That which he Depoſeth is briefly this, namely, <hi>That</hi> Smith <hi>perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>

                  <hi>and standing upon the Bill of Excluſion, was pretence enough ſor any man to Swear, that there was a Deſign against the King, and that the King was to he apprehended.</hi> And as theſe Witneſſes ought not to be diſallowed by the managers of this <hi>Protestant</hi> Plot, ſeing they are made uſe of by themſelves, ſo they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove <hi>Smith</hi> to be an infamous and ſuborning Raſcal. But beſides the Depoſitions unfold and declare the whole Myſtery of this pretended <hi>protestant</hi> Conſpiracy. For whoſoever are either againſt a Popiſh Succeſſor, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give Money till they know how it ſhall be employed and applied, are to be Sworn againſt as Guilty of a Deſign to Depoſe the King and alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that there is no mean, if theſe men have their Will, but we muſt either ſubmit to be Papiſts and Slaves, or elſe we muſt be content to be deſtroyed as Rebels and Traitors, in the way of a Legal Proceſs. I think we may
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199172:47"/> ſay now upon the whole of what hath been declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Smith,</hi> that that man is not careful of his own Credit, who will give credit to this fellows Teſtimony. And whatſoever Jury ſhould find a Bill upon this Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Evidence, may be juſtly eſteemed to put their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Life in jeopardy, upon the Oath of a ſuborned and perjured Rogue. Nor can they who ſhall hereafter bring in a Verdict againſt Proteſtants upon <hi>Smith</hi>'s Depoſition, be thought to have duly regarded or conſidered the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Witneſs, or the credibility of the Evidence; but rather be judged by all to have purſued either their own Animoſities, or the unjuſt Quarrels of other men.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs who at the proceeding at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> ſwore againſt that Honourable Peer the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was <hi>Brian Haynes,</hi> a fellow ſtigmatized and branded with the infamy of ſo many Crimes, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceth any Cauſe which he is produced in the favour of For ſeeming <hi>Angels</hi> are not to be believed, when they are in fellowſhip, and ſpeak in conſort with Helliſh <hi>Fiends.</hi> It were endleſs to recount the Enormities of his Life, all his days having been ſpent in wickedneſs and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy.

Yea Perjury it ſelf, which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:199172:47"/> is the moſt fatal and deſtructive ſin to the Safety and Peace of Mankind, is a Trade which he hath been long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed unto.

                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>had an hand in putting the Plot upon Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> Proteſtants; <hi>and that he was offered a Pardon and</hi> 500 l, <hi>if he would ſwear ſuch and ſuch baſe things,</hi> That is, if he would accuſe the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbary</hi> and other Loyal Patriots of Religion and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, of being guilty of a Conſpiracy againſt his Majeſty, and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government. And the Fellow being in great want, and having long before ſhipwrack't his Conſcience, he was eaſily brought to comply with this wicked and abominable Propoſal. For as he told <hi>Mowbray, His neceſſitous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition made him take deſperate Reſolutions, and that to make his Fortune, he would ſwear a Plot againſt the</hi> Preſbyterians, <hi>in reference to whom any plauſable thing would be believed.</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:199172:49"/> And that the World may know of how long ſtanding this forged Conſpiracy has been, I ſhall here add ſomething of <hi>Sampſon's</hi> Depoſition upon Oath before an <hi>Alderman</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which may ſerve further to enlighten this Affair. He ſwears, <hi>That</hi> John Macknamarra <hi>told him, that</hi> Edward Ivey <hi>and</hi> Bryan Hayns <hi>agreed together in</hi> April <hi>last, to ſwear Treaſon against the Earl of</hi> Shaftſbury, <hi>and that the Treaſon which they reſolved to ſwear, was, That the ſaid Earl ſhould ſay, That this King deſerved more to be dethroned than</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard <hi>the ſecond; and that he the ſaid Earl vvould dethrone the King, and make</hi> England <hi>a Common-Wealth; and that if the Bill againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftſbury <hi>were once found, that then they with</hi> Smith, Turbervil, <hi>and others would ſwear Treaſon against many more.</hi> And as we may be ſure, that the Villan's being a Papiſt, diſpoſed him the more readily to venture upon a Deſign which was judged ſo ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Intereſt, ſo it were worth the while to inform the World with what Court-Miniſters, and little Officers he ſecretly correſponded all the time he pretended to abſcond. But as thoſe perſons muſt be left to ſuffer by Juſtice of a Parliament, ſo all the Diſcoveries relating to a cloſe Converſe between thoſe Gentlemen and <hi>Hayns,</hi> muſt be deferred till this whole matter fall under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the Two Houſes. But ſo zealous of a ſudden did the Raſcal become in ruining <hi>Proteſtants</hi> upon this forged Plot, That he not only <hi>called the Parliament at</hi> Oxford <hi>a company of Rogues, becauſe they would give the King no Money; but that by doing</hi> Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <hi>and other Proteſtants buſineſs, they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colledge's Trial, p. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>would help him to Money out of the</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiks <hi>eſtates; for they would rather damn their Souls to the Devil, than that the Catholick Cauſe ſhould ſink.</hi> If men did not chuſe the being impoſed upon, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:199172:49"/> were not obſtinate againſt conviction, they might have been ſatisfied long ago, that there was no Truth nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in all the talk and noiſe which we have had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Plot; but that it is only the invention of ill men, inſtructed and acted by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving the ſinking Cauſe and Intereſt of the Catholick Church in theſe Nations. And they have pitched upon Tools who are either wholly fearleſs of Damnation, or ſuch who upon a promiſe of Happineſs in this world, are reſolved to venture it. So that upon what hath been here with all Truth as well as Brevity repreſented concerning this Fellow <hi>Haynes,</hi> I hope that at leaſt all the ſober part of Mankind will ſee cauſe for juſtifying the late Jury in their not believing his Teſtimony. Nor have I inſiſted upon half the Crimes and groſs Immoralities of his Life, ſuch as his forging a Letter to one Mr. <hi>Harbottle</hi> of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> in order to cozen a Gentleman of Goods, to the value of 200 <hi>l.</hi> And his marrying one Mrs. <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and then turning her away, after he had lived divers years with her, and ſpent 500 <hi>l.</hi> which ſhe brought him, pretending ſhe was but his Whore, becauſe they were not married according to the Form of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but after the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faſhion; tho' he that is guilty of ſuch things ought not to be believed, unleſs the matter he ſwears carry a probability in it, or be rendred morally certain by Circumſtances which are either notorious, or otherwiſe confirmed. No inſtead of recounting ſuch Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes and Immoralities, I have rather choſen to make him appear an infamous Raſcal, and one to whoſe <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> concerning a <hi>Protestant</hi> Plot no credit is to be given, by declaring his own acknowledgments of the whole For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and upon what Motives and through whoſe Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he liſted himſelf for a Witneſs, and what was the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:199172:50"/> 
                  <hi>end</hi> which the Managers of this Deſign propoſed ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately unto themſelves, &amp; with reſpect to which they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd the murdering of innocent men would be eſteem'd a holy and meritorious ſervice. And I ſhall only add to what hath been ſaid, That the wretch plainly contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the face of the Court. <hi>For being asked by the Jury, Whether he had not given an Information to a Juſtice of Peace, concerning ſome deſign againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>he twice denied his having given ſuch an Information to any, ſave Secretary</hi> Jenkins; <hi>yet upon my Lord Chief Juſtice's tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he did not obſerve the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and propoſing it again to him, he</hi>

                  <hi>at laſt accknowledged, that he had given an Information to Sir</hi> George Treby, <hi>how Mr.</hi> Fitz-Gerald <hi>had both told the King, and given it under his hand, That the Earl of</hi> Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury <hi>was reſolved to ſet the Crown upon his own head, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, to turn the Kingdom into a Common wealth.</hi> I wonder how their Lordſhips, and more eſpecially, how the Kings Council, who ſeemed to lay great weight upon his Teſtimony, could forbear bluſhing, to hear a fellow ſay, not only once, <hi>That he had given ſuch an Information to none, ſave to Secretary</hi> Jenkins, but to add a ſecond time, <hi>No, no; to none except Secretary</hi> Jenkins, and yet upon the hint which my Lord<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Chief Juſtice gave him, to acknowledg in the next breath, <hi>That he had given ſuch an Information to Sir</hi> George Treby. And tho' the Court might take no notice of this ſhameful contradiction, yet we may be ſure, that the Jury, as well as a great many Gentlemen beſides, did.</p>
               <p>The next perſon whom His Majeſties Learned Council at Law produced as a Witneſs of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s being
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199172:50"/> guilty of Treaſon againſt the King and his Government, and upon whoſe Teſtimony they not only <hi>ſtak'd</hi> the belief of a Proteſtant Plot, but ventur'd both the Honour of the Government, and their own Wiſdom and Diſcretion, was <hi>John Macknamarra,</hi> a fellow of the ſame ſtamp with the reſt and faſhioned in the ſame mould for the preſent Deſign. His early immoralities, as well as the ſtraitneſs and penury of his condition, gave not only the managers of this <hi>Sham</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, encouragement to aſſault him, but rendred him diſpoſed for, and capable of their impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For both <hi>John Row</hi> and <hi>Francis Foulk,</hi> Gentlemen of good Quality, and Juſtices of the Peace in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> do teſtifie, <hi>That he was not only an idle, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pilfering boy, but that being put upon his Oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome goods which he was ſuſpected to have ſtollen from one of his Masters Daughters, he denied to have taken them, when nevertheleſs, upon ſearch they were taken about him.</hi> And his progreſs in Roguery, encreaſed anſwerably to his growth in years. For the ſame Gentlemen do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That he and his brother</hi> Dennis, <hi>uſed frequently to bring Horſes to graze on</hi> Camphaire <hi>Bogg, which afterwards, upon enquiry, were found to be ſtollen from ſome remote places, but that his bouſe was known to be the greateſt receptacle in the County of</hi> Clare <hi>for Rogues and Thieves.</hi> And now finding himſelf in a Kingdom where he could not ſubſiſt by <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealing,</hi> nor take ſanctuary in Boggs when purſued, as he did in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was glad to find ſuch a Trade ſet up, as a man might get both Money and Countenance, meerly for forſwearing himſelf, to relieve and advance the Catholick Cauſe. For that his condition was become extreamly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, appears not only from the Petition which he and others preſented to the City for a maintenance, but is atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by divers, to whom in converſe, he every day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199172:51"/> of it. And whereas he (as well as the reſt) doth pretend, That that Petition ſpake neither his Language nor Caſe, but was framed for them by others; particularly, <hi>That</hi> Colledg <hi>was concerned in promoting that Petition, by my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury'<hi>s advice;</hi> and that <hi>he neither read it, nor knew what was in it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Samſon</hi> not only ſwears, <hi>That he ſaw them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate</hi>

                  <hi>it to the Scrivener who drew it, but that</hi> John Macknamarra <hi>told him, how they intended to evade the ſtreſs laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for weakening the credit of their Teſtimony, by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that it was made for them by the City.</hi> And foraſmuch as this fellow being queſtioned by the Grand Jury at <hi>Rous</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>how he was maintained, had the impudence to anſwer, That he did then rent a hundred pound</hi> per annum <hi>in</hi> Ireland. That thing is altogether falſe, as is both atteſted by Mr. <hi>Samſon</hi> upon Oath, and confirmed by Letters and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from perſons in that Kingdom, who very well knew the Raſcal, and are themſelves of unqueſtionable Honour and Reputation. Such a ſtranger was <hi>John Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namarra</hi> to the reality of a Proteſtant Plot, or the time when he pretends the Treaſonable words were ſpoken by that Noble Peer, that there are ſeveral perſons, whom all ſober men will give entire belief unto, who not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That he uſed about that time to aver there was no ſuch thing, but that he alſo uſed to faſten very ſevere Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon ſuch as took upon them to ſay there was.

For he not only acknowledged to Mr. <hi>Samuel Harris, ſhortly after the ſaid</hi> Macnamarra <hi>was bail'd out of</hi> Newgate, <hi>and alſo at divers times afterwards to Mr.</hi> John Wilmer, <hi>That Coll.</hi> Warcup <hi>had been with him, and earneſtly ſolicited him to come to</hi> Whitehal, <hi>telling him that he might have great advantages by ſo doing; and that the Juſtice ſpake this in ſuch a manner and way, as gave him reaſon to ſuſpect a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of frustrating his Evidence against the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying him in ſome very ill Deſign:</hi> But he likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Pain,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Bull,</hi> and ſeveral others, <hi>That</hi> Warcup <hi>had offered him ſeveral

For Mr. <hi>Shewen</hi> ſwears, <hi>That being on the 11th of</hi> Auguſt <hi>in company with</hi> Smith <hi>and</hi> Macknamarra, <hi>the ſaid</hi> Macknamarra <hi>told</hi> Smith, <hi>That the reaſon why he could not ſooner wait upon him that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:199172:52"/> was becauſe he had been with Sir</hi> L. J. <hi>who had given him a long Leſſon, which nevertheleſs he had learned, tho' it was very long.</hi> To that height of Impudence and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany was this Varlet arrived, through the encouragement and protection which he received from ſome great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom it would have better become to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their Authority and Power according to the Rules of Juſtice and Honour, that as if it had not been wicked and immodeſt enough to owne his being ſuborned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he made it his buſineſs to ſuborn others. For ſo much doth <hi>Mowbray</hi> Depoſe againſt him, who tho' he is become himſelf one of the Swearing <hi>Gang,</hi> yet his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is not thereby weakned, but is rather the ſtronger, being againſt one of his <hi>Complices.</hi> To that Immodeſty and Inſolence was this mercinary audacious Wretch grown, that if a perſon did but decline the gratifying his covetous and inſatiable deſires, he was prepared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Swear Treaſon againſt him. For Mr. <hi>Chaffin</hi> Depoſeth, <hi>That he heard</hi> John Macnamarra <hi>ſay, He would Swear Treaſon againſt a Merchant in the City, if he would not give him ſuch a Sum of Money as he demanded of him.</hi> Whether upon the whole, the original Authors and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Managers of this <hi>Sham</hi> expected to reap any honour to themſelves, or credit to the Conſpiracy which they would have father'd upon <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> from the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Witneſs, I cannot tell; but I think it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from what hath been ſaid in relation to him, that no unbiaſſed perſons, nor wiſe and honeſt Juries, could have peace in themſelves, nor approve their actings to God and the world, ſhould they in the caſe before us give faith to this Fellow's Teſtimony. Nor would I have the Conductors of this malicious and forged Deſign againſt the Lives of innocent perſons think, but that as we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199172:53"/> are very ſenſible, how unjuſtly and induſtriouſly they have been purſuing our ruin, ſo we are not ignorant of their treacherous and wicked carriage, from firſt to laſt, in this Affair. For let me tell them, That while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they act behind a <hi>Curtain,</hi> they do but dance in a <hi>net.</hi> And while they imagine, that they remain ſafe through their ſtanding in the dark, they are both as well known, and their methods as fully underſtood, as if they had appeared and acted in a meridian light. And whenſoever it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, there are thoſe in the world, that know how to repreſent them ſtript of the mask and diſguiſe under which they have gone.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs that ſtept up to give Evidence againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was <hi>Dennis Macknamarra, John</hi>'s true Brother in all Wickedneſs and Perjuries, as well as in Blood. For having acted in co-partnerſhip ſo long in the Horſe-ſtealing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trade, they were not to be ſeparated in this new <hi>courſe</hi> of Livelihood which was propoſed unto them, provided they would perjure themſelves, and ſwear Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants guilty of a Plot. Nor is this a groundleſs ſurmiſe of mine; but Mr. <hi>Samſon</hi> hath depoſed upon Oath, That both he and others heard <hi>Dennis Macknamarra</hi> ſay, <hi>That he would ſwear any thing that his Brother</hi> John <hi>would have him to ſwear.</hi> And whoſoever acts implicitely upon the advice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch a guide, ought to be eſteemed and judged of, according to the Principles and Practices of his Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. But beſides, the fellow was himſelf immediately tempted with promiſes both of a preſent Reward and a ſtanding Salary, if he would ſwear Treaſon againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſuch others as ſhould be named un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and the ſilly Raſcal wanting Wit, as well as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Conſcience, became eaſily conquered by ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble as well as great temptations. For the wretch knows no
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:199172:53"/> Law but that of his belly, nor underſtands any more Senſe or Reaſon, that what is declared in the offers of food and money. And we are aſſured by perſons, whoſe integrity was never ſuſpected, That <hi>Dennis Macknamarra told them, he was profer'd great ſums of money, to go off from his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Papiſts, and to ſwear againſt Proteſtants.</hi> This is directly and poſitively depoſed againſt him by Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Payne,</hi> with this addition, <hi>That Juſtice</hi> Warcup <hi>was the man who endeavoured to corrupt and ſuborn him.</hi> And withal, he laid open to the <hi>Dr.</hi> the methods and ſteps in which the <hi>Juſtice</hi> did this baſe and villanous thing. And tho' the ſucceſs of <hi>Warcup</hi>'s application to ſuborn him, be now evident in the effects of it, yet I ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it from <hi>Dennis Macknamarra</hi>'s own acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Mr. <hi>Peter Norris.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> being in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with him, and repreſenting that he wanted money, <hi>Dennis Macknamarra</hi> thereupon replied, <hi>We are all Fools, for</hi> David Fitz Gerald <hi>lives like a Prince, wanting neither Money nor Gold, while in the mean time, ſaid he, we can hardly have bread; and damn me, ſaid he, if we had done as he did at firſt, we had been better than we are; but damn me, we will do it yet;</hi> and with that, the ſaid <hi>Dennis Macknamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra pulled a paper out of his pocket, and ſaid, If Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>would ſet his Hand to that paper, he the ſaid</hi> Macknamarra <hi>would warrant him they ſhould do better.</hi> But I ſhall not deduce, nor purſue what we have againſt him to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther length; for ſeeing this little fellow is no otherwiſe to be conſidered, than as an <hi>Appendix</hi> of his Brother, we may reaſonably therefore hope, that the Credit of the one, as to the ſupporting the belief of a Proteſtant Plot, being blaſted and overthrown, the Credit of the other runs the ſame deſtiny. The Reputation of the Acceſſary falls with that of the Principal. Yet what we have here offered from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:199172:54"/> his own acknowledgments, concerning his being ſuborned, is enough, ſhould he be weighed, as abſtracted from any dependance upon his Brother <hi>John,</hi> to render him, and make him appear to be no leſs in this whole matter, than a perjured and infamous Raſcal. And we pity our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, as driven to very low ſhifts, in that they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to produce, to prove the chiefeſt men of <hi>England</hi> guilty of Treaſon, but ſuch fooliſh wretches as could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceal their own Mercinarineſs and Perjuries, nor the Villanies of thoſe who had ſuborn'd and corrupted them.</p>
               <p>The next perſon whom the Managers of the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> thought fit to venture the Truth and Proof of the Charge againſt him upon, is <hi>Edward Ivey,</hi> one that is infamous to a very Proverb, and who diſgraceth the Name of a Gentleman, by pretending to the Title and Appellation. That he hath been Convicted and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Robbery, appears from the Certificate which I ſhall here ſubjoin.</p>

               <p>He that could be guilty in Robbing his own Siſter, will decline nothing that is Criminal, if the committing it be but ſubſervient to his Ambition or Covetouſneſs. For having violated the Obligations of Nature, he can be under no confinement from ſubordinate Laws. It were endleſs to recount the Enormities of his Life, whereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Action hath been a Scandal: I ſhall therefore only detect thoſe Villanies which he hath perpetrated, to the rendring him infamous, as well as the proclaiming him prodigiouſly wicked. He was no ſooner pardoned for one <hi>Felony,</hi> but he committed <hi>another.</hi> For having liſted himſelf for a Trooper and gone to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> he there married a <hi>ſecond Wife,</hi> tho' his <hi>firſt</hi> was ſtill living. And finding it was diſcovered, and that there was a Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commencing againſt him, he thereupon fled to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being never heard of again in his own Country, till he appeared as one of the King's Evidence concerning a <hi>Popiſh Plot.</hi> For His Majeſty having promiſed in his Royal Proclamations, that whoſoever came in by ſuch a time to detect the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt His Perſon and the Government, ſhould thereupon be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; this cunning Raſcal thought with himſelf he might ſafely venture hither, as reckoning that his Felonies would be included in his Pardon as well as his Treaſons. To this I might add his having lived ſome time this laſt Summer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:199172:55"/> with a Woman, whom he ſwore God damn him he was Married unto, which Woman proved in the end to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans Wife, and was accordingly taken out of Bed from him by her Husband on the ſecond of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> at Night. But whereas <hi>He ſaid upon Oath at Mr.</hi> Rouſe's <hi>Trial, that he came not over to</hi> England <hi>to diſcover the</hi> Popiſh Plot; it is not only known to all who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing of the late Tranſactions, that this was his pretence, and that accordingly he made a large Diſcovery; but withal Mr. <hi>Samſon</hi> alſo ſwears, <hi>There was twenty Pound allowed the ſaid</hi> Ivey <hi>by my Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of</hi> Ireland, <hi>to defray his paſſage hither, in order to his revealing the Popiſh Plot.</hi> Who can blame a fellow of his Principles, that hath a latitude to ſwear and forſwear as he finds it for his intereſt, if he diſclaim the having come hither upon an errand which he is ſo little thank'd for, and which is not likely to conduce ſo much to his profit as he imagined it would. The forming a <hi>Proteſtant Plot,</hi> and ſuborning others as well as coming in himſelf to ſwear Treaſon againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and other Patriots of our Religion and Civil Liberties, is a deſign that will turn to better account and give him an eſteem with ſome men, beyond what ever the former dull Trade would have done.

                  </gap>ter end, for one of his genius and ſtamp to bear himſelf upon as the grand motive of his Journey hither. But whereas <hi>he Swore likewiſe the time when the Bill was preferred againſt</hi> Rous, <hi>that the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>did uſually dictate to him the Information he drew up and Depoſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popiſh Plot;</hi> There are divers perſons, and amongſt others Mr. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who do teſtifie they ſaw thoſe Informations in his hand, before ever he knew the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> And ſeeing <hi>he further declared at the ſame time, that ſome Informations which he had given in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:199172:55"/> here againſt the</hi> Papiſts <hi>were wholy falſe; and that he made Oath of them only, becauſe Mr.</hi> Rouſe <hi>would not otherwiſe give any Money,</hi> ought not all Mankind therefore to eſteem him as a Villain, and as one that is perjur'd upon Record. Nor could any thing more amaze the thinking part of Mankind, than that when this miſcreant had declared himſelf perjured in open Court, he ſhould yet be produced again the next Seſſions; and that againſt no leſs conſiderable perſon, than the right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is. But whether we are to aſcribe it to exceſs of rage in ſome men againſt that Noble Peer, or whether we are to attribute it to a Divine infatuation, upon the Managers of the Bill of Indictment, I cannot tell; but I dare boldly ſay, That both the Jury, and hundreds in the Court beſides, were able to gueſs at the maliciouſneſs of that Proſecution, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude within themſelves, That whatſoever was alleadged to render that excellent Patriot guilty of Treaſon, was all forgery and groundleſs invention.</p>
               <p>But that we may yet further expoſe this fellow <hi>Ivey,</hi> and that at the ſame time unveil this whole Combination, wherein ſome ill men have been engaged, in order to the Subverſion of our Liberties and Religion, or againſt the lives of the greateſt, and moſt innocent <hi>proteſtants;</hi> I ſhall in the next place obſerve, that he both ſpake of ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign while it was in agitation and forming, and embark'd in it upon promiſes of Reward himſelf, but endeavoured to corrupt and ſuborn others to joyn in the ſame Villany. Accordingly Captain <hi>Yarrington</hi> informs, <hi>That being one morning in bed at Mr.</hi> Stephen Colledges, <hi>he there heard Mr.</hi> Ivey <hi>acquaint Mr.</hi> Colledg <hi>with a Deſing that was then on foot, for framing of a Plot against</hi> Proteſtants; <hi>and that they were to be accuſed of a Conſpiracy against the Monarchy, and for depoſing the King.</hi> And Mr. <hi>John Jenks</hi> depoſeth, <hi>That
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:199172:56"/> Mr.</hi> Ivey <hi>confeſſed to him, how he had great offers made him, provided he would ſwear againſt</hi> Proteſtants. And Mr. <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> ſays, that <hi>Ivy</hi> one day told him, <hi>He had been with the ſaid Lord, and that my Lord</hi> Hyde <hi>had order'd him to ſend at any time to him, and he ſhould have money.</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Aſhlock</hi> further adds, <hi>That he ſaw a Letter directed to my Lord</hi> Hyde <hi>from</hi> Ivey, <hi>which</hi> Ivey <hi>ſaid was for money.</hi> Now that <hi>Ivey</hi> was neceſſitous, and the more likely to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned for money, to ſwear any thing that was falſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not only by the Petition preſented to my <hi>Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and the <hi>Common Council,</hi> which he among others ſubſcribed; but more eſpecially from his own Teſtimony in Court, at the time when Mr. <hi>Rowſe</hi> was indicted; ſeeing he then owned, <hi>That he had falſly ſworn ſuch things meerly, becauſe he could not otherwiſe get mony.</hi> And that this <hi>Proteſtant Plot</hi> was hatched by this hired ſuborned Raſcal and others, who in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt and deſigns of the Papiſts, had combined to aſperſe Loyal Perſons with the imputation of Treaſon, and to make the chief Protectors under his Majeſty of our Religion and Liberties, periſh in the form and courſe of Juſtice, does appears by what Mr. <hi>Sampſon</hi> hath depoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, namely, <hi>That</hi> John Macknamarra <hi>told him how he and</hi> Ivey, <hi>having been with the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had refuſed to diſcourſe with them alone, ſaying, He never diſcourſed with any but in the preſence of his Servants; and that I being thereupon very greatly diſgusted, contrived by way of Revenge, to ſwear High Treaſon againſt him.</hi> Not but that the Deſign of accuſing my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> of Treaſon, was laid by others, but <hi>Ivey</hi> being ſuborned to be a Witneſs againſt him, he therefore ſought an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſpeaking with his Lordſhip alone, the better to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he ſhould afterwards ſay againſt him, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:199172:56"/> However having upon ſome inſtigation or other entertain'd a Reſolution of ſwearing Treaſon againſt this Loyal and Noble Lord; his next buſineſs was to procure others to fortifie his Teſtimony, and ſecond him in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhould ſay. Accordingly he applies to <hi>Haynes; aſſuring him in the names of ſeveral Lords, That he ſhould not only have his pardon, but five hundred pounds, provided</hi> (as Mrs. <hi>Wingfield Haynes</hi>'s Mother-in-Law, told Mrs. <hi>Hall,</hi> and <hi>Mary Richards) he would faſten a Plot upon Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and ſwear against ſeveral Lords.</hi> Nay, Mr. <hi>Zell</hi> one of Juſtice <hi>Warcups</hi> preſent Darlings, and whoſe Teſtimony he ought not to decline againſt <hi>Ivey,</hi> having ſo lately made uſe of it in the Court of <hi>Verge,</hi> to vindicate himſelf; I ſay, this <hi>Zell</hi> hath depoſed upon Oath, <hi>That</hi> Ivey <hi>would have perſwaded him to ſwear High Treaſon againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>and by way of Argument to influence him to a compliance, told him, That the E. of</hi> H. <hi>my L.</hi> H. <hi>my L.</hi> C. <hi>and Mr.</hi> S. <hi>were a Commitee to give aſſurances of Pardons, and to allow Gratuites to all that would ſwear against that Lord, and that there is a</hi> Preſbyterian Plot. And tho' I am not willing to believe thoſe great Miniſters guilty of this which <hi>Zell</hi> ſays <hi>Ivey</hi> reported of them, yet it is ſomething ſtrange, that knowing it from Prints as well as otherwiſe, they have not endeavoured to get that Rogue puniſhed for defaming of them. And I do verily think it would be as much for the Honour of the Government, and for the Reputation of theſe States-men, to have this fellow, and the reſt, who have uſed the like Language concerning them, either proſecuted by way of Action or Information; as it will prove in the iſſue that the <hi>Attorney General</hi> is proſecuting one <hi>Baldwin</hi> for having publiſhed a Book called <hi>No Proteſtant Plot;</hi> wherein ſo far as very good and wiſe men can ſee, there is not any thing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:199172:57"/> criminal, unleſs it be a Crime to detect the Deſigns of the Papiſts againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to vindicate the innocency of thoſe, who (as it hath appeared by the verdicts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) were falſly and unrighteouſly accuſed. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I ſuppoſe from what hath been here declared, and laid open concerning <hi>Ivey,</hi> there will not many be found who are credible perſons themſelves, that will look upon him hereafter, as a credible Witneſs in reference to a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Plot. Nor is the bringing the Lives of Innocents into hazard, upon the Teſtimony of a wretch branded with ſo many capital Offences, and who beſides hath been ſo evidently tamper'd with, to be any other way expiated or attoned for, but by bringing both him and his Abettors to condign puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The laſt Witneſs made uſe towards the proving the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was <hi>Bernard Dennis,</hi> a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as lewd in his Morals as any of the reſt, and drawn and procured to be an Evidence againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by the ſame means and arts that they were. Nor is he only an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> man, but of one of the moſt ſottiſh bigotted bloody <hi>Clans</hi>'s of all that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.<note place="margin">

                  </note> And upon the beſt enquiry I can make, there is not one <hi>Iriſh</hi> man of his Name in that whole Nation, who is known to be a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> I ſhould not have mentioned this, if the fellow upon being ask'd whether all his Kindred were not Papiſts, had not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>he could not ſay ſo.</hi> And yet were he put to it, he will not be able to name one Perſon neither in the County where he was born, where<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 32.</note> he ſays <hi>there are ſo many of them,</hi> nor in the whole Country beſides, that is not a Papiſt, if withal they be not of the moſt violent and bloodily diſpoſed ſort.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:199172:57"/> And whereas he once told Mr. <hi>Wilmore</hi> (they two being diſcourſing together about the principles of the Papiſts), that the Papiſts <hi>valued no more the life of a Heretick, than they did that of a Dog,</hi> it is moſt probable, that he therein ſpake the Senſe of his Kindred, and publiſhed what they had of old infuſed into him. I will not enquire what Religion he is of at preſent, ſeeing no form nor kind of Religion can give him a Reputation, but he reflects diſhonour upon whatſoever Religion he doth profeſs. Only I wiſh, that the Papiſts have not <hi>Sham'd</hi> him upon the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he may the better, and under the fairer name, Sham a Plot upon Proteſtants. And who knows, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reſpect paid to his Teſtimony at the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> becauſe he there profeſſed himſelf a Papiſt, he might thereupon hope it would advantage him in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved againſt a Proteſtant, by liſting himſelf in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Proteſtant Church. The forgery of this Plot would have been too obvious, ſhould <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts have come forth, as the principal Witneſſes, to prove the beſt Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> concerned in a Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt His Majeſty and the Government; but the producing none for Evidence, but Members of our own Church, does help to hide and conceal the Villany. And I beg the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pardon for my jealouſie in this matter, becauſe tho' he told the <hi>Jury,</hi> that he had been a Proteſtant ſince <hi>February</hi> laſt, yet he never ſought to be received into the boſom of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, till about the month of <hi>June,</hi> which was near the time that the Mine which had been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid againſt Proteſtants, was juſt ready to ſpring. Nor were things ſo much better for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt, and worſe for the Popiſh<note place="margin">Ibid p. 47.</note> in <hi>February,</hi> than they had been in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> before, that a fellow who makes Religion always
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:199172:58"/> ſubſervient to his ſafety and gain, and who had been a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt in <hi>November,</hi> ſhould think of abandoning the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for to be taken into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and embraces of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>February</hi> following. But be he of what Religion ſoever he pleaſeth, I ſtill ſay, he is a wicked and flagitious fellow. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he acknowledgeth, that in the courſe of his Travels, he had been in <hi>Maryland,</hi> as well as in divers other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, he muſt give us leave to remember himſelf of, and acquaint the world with a good token of it. For beſides ſeveral Debaucheries, and leſſer enormities he was guilty of there, he was apprehended not only <hi>for felony, in ſtealing a Watch, but for Sacriledg, in breaking into a Church and carrying away the Communion Plate.</hi> But being I grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in raking ſo long in <hi>Sinks</hi> and <hi>Kennels,</hi> I ſhall therefore wave the inſiſting upon theſe things, or the deducing them to any further length. Since he came hither, he hath been always extreamly neceſſitous, but never in greater penury, than immediately before he ſtarted up a Witneſs in this new Plot. For as he wanted bread, otherwiſe than as he was from day to day relieved by the Charity of ſuch compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate perſons, to whom he bewailed the miſerableneſs of his condition, ſo I have heard from a good hand, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arreſted for <hi>Fifteen</hi> or <hi>Seventeen ſhillings,</hi> he was ſo poor, that he muſt have gone to the <hi>Counter,</hi> if a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that paſſed by had not out of meer pity ſent him a <hi>Guinee</hi> to diſcharge the Debt and the Serjeants Fees. And how eaſie was it to corrupt and ſuborn ſuch a fellow, who as he had no Principles of Vertue or Honour, to preſerve him againſt the temptations wherewith he was aſſaulted, ſo the pinching wants, under which he laboured, rendred him a prey to any that would hire him with ready money, or give him any aſſurance of a plentiful ſubſiſtence. Now it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199172:58"/> not only appears from the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boulter,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mary Cox,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Norton,</hi> and divers others, that by his own acknowledgment and confeſſion to them, <hi>both</hi> Warcup <hi>and</hi> Fitz-Gerald <hi>had tempted him with great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Gold and Silver, if he would depart from his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Papiſts, and ſwear Treaſon againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>my Lord</hi> Howard, <hi>and ſeveral other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, but it is likewiſe depoſed by</hi> Mr. Samuel Oats, <hi>that</hi> Dennis <hi>ſhould ſay, If the Proteſtants did not help him to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it would cauſe him to do that which he never intended.</hi> But what need I inſiſt upon the Depoſitions of others, in proof, that he had frequently confeſſed his being tempted with tenders of great matters, to retract what he had ſworn againſt the Papiſts, and ſwear, that the Proteſtants were embarkt in a Conſpiracy againſt the King, <hi>ſeeing he himſelf hath depoſed all this upon Oath before Sir</hi> Patience Ward, <hi>when he was Lord Mayor.</hi> And as this may fully convince all that are not in the Plot themſelves, for the deſtroying ſuch as are the chief Bulwarks, under His Majeſty, of our Religion and Liberties, that whatſoever this fellow hath ſworn againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> or any Proteſtant elſe, is all meer Fiction, <hi>Romance,</hi> and abominable Forgery, ſo we have beſides all this, the Teſtimony both of Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> and Captain <hi>Yarrington,</hi> That this wretch <hi>did protest unto them, at the very time when he told them of his being tempted, that before God, he knew nothing whereof to accuſe any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant in the world; and that if he ſhould do any ſuch thing, he ſhould be the greateſt Rogue under Heaven.</hi> And as their way of living ſince, and their boaſting, of having their Pockets full of money, does plainly proclaim to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, upon what motives they have perjured themſelves, and how well they have been rewarded for their falſe ſwearing, ſo there is one <hi>George Dennis,</hi> a <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199172:59"/> depoſeth, <hi>That to his knowledg, the Witneſſes who ſwore againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>had an Hundred, or an Hundred and Fifty Pound a man for ſo doing; and that he might have had as much, if he would have Sworn againſt the ſaid Earl.</hi> Having thus truely and briefly drawn and repreſented the Witneſſes according to their juſt and true Features, and having fully diſcovered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination which they and others are engaged in againſt our Lives and Religion, and having particularly detected how theſe mercinary Wretches have been hired and ſuborned to ſwear a Plot upon <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which themſelves and their Abettors have out of hatred to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties invented and forged againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons: I ſhall now leave them thus ſhown and expoſed, to undergo the puniſhments which theſe unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Villainies ſubject them unto; and in the mean time till the Adminiſtrators of publick Juſtice ſhall eſteem it their Duty and for the honour of the Government to make their Puniſhment as exemplar, as their Crimes have been; I do here ſet them up as proper objects of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency and deteſtation of mankind, and perſons not worthy to be believed by any honeſt rational <hi>Jury</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</hi> And I ſhall only add, that the late <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> inſtead of deſerving to be cenſured for returning an <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi> upon the <hi>Bills</hi> which theſe Miſcreants ſwore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they are rather to be blam'd for not immediately In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting them of a Conſpiracy againſt the Lives and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Noble and Guiltleſs Perſons. Nor is it enough for a <hi>Grand Jury</hi> merely to reject a <hi>Bill,</hi> which they find promoted from Malice, and upon a Combination; but they are bound, both by the Laws of God and the Laws of the Land, to Indict the Conſpirators and all ſuch as ſhall appear to have abetted them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whereas we have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:199172:59"/> not only heard of ſeveral other Witneſſes, who either had or were ready to Swear Treaſon againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> but have been told, that ſeveral of their Names had been endorſed on the back of the <hi>Bill</hi> which was preferred againſt his Lordſhip, who yet upon ſecond thoughts were blotted out and expunged. We ſhall only ſay, that we think it needleſs to attempt the expoſing of thoſe, whom the Managers themſelves judged ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that they were aſhamed to make uſe of them. But as we may be ſure that they produced all theſe, whoſe Credit they could in any degree rely upon, ſo had they brought an hundred more, whom we might neither have known, nor had opportunity to enquire after, yet find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in conjunction with ſuch infamous Villains as theſe we have named, it had been a moſt unreaſonable, unjuſt, and unwiſe thing to believe them. But can any man take Mrs. <hi>Tereſia Peacock</hi> to be a credible Witneſs, who beſides her being a more common Proſtitute than any in the publick Stews, was found to be a falſe and perjured <hi>huſſey</hi> in the Depoſition which ſhe gave againſt My Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> before the Grand Jury at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the laſt <hi>Midſummer</hi> Term. For whereas her <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> and <hi>ſhe</hi> had Sworn Treaſon againſt that <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> and accorded in every particular whilſt they were together; they plainly contradicted each other, when they once came to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined apart. For the <hi>Miſtriſs</hi> being ask'd how her <hi>Maid</hi> came to hear My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſpeak the Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words which were Sworn and Depoſed, replied, that the <hi>Wench</hi> had arrived at the knowledg of them, by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearkning behind a door; but the ſame Queſtion being propoſed to Mis. <hi>Tereſia,</hi> ſhe affirmed ſhe was as much truſted by my Lord, as Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> her ſelf; and that he had ſaid ſo and ſo to her, purſuant of the intimacy
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199172:60"/> which ſhe had with him, and the confidence which he placed in her. Which as it was an uncontroulable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her having perjur'd her ſelf, ſo it was a happy means of diſcovering the Conſpiracy againſt the Life of that wiſe and generous Lord. And for <hi>David Fitz-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> there are not only an hundred Teſtimonies againſt him, to render him the moſt profligate and infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alive; but the very Witneſſes which were produced in Court againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> have teſtiſied to ſeveral of His Majeſties Juſtice upon Oath, how he had tampered with them, and what pains he had taken to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn them. So that I may boldly ſay, the Managers of this <hi>Intrigue</hi> are liable to be called to account for not proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> on the Depoſitions of thoſe, upon whoſe Teſtimony they took the boldneſs to Indict this Great and Noble Peer. And whereas there is one Sir <hi>James Hayes,</hi> who upon his ſwearing againſt Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> had been repreſented to the world in more modeſt terms than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that nevertheleſs hath had the confidence to vindicate himſelf in a<note place="margin">

I do therefore affirm, that he was not only guilty of all the Villanies whereof he was there accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that there are many more Rogueries chargeable upon him, than were there mentioned. <hi>For beſides his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been heretofore in the</hi> Kings Bench, <hi>for Knavery and Debt, and his being neceſſitated at preſent to conceal himſelf from his Creditors; and his having been reduced to ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, as to receive two pence of Mr.</hi> Peter <hi>the Chyrurgeon by way of relief; I ſay beſides all this, he is not only known to have been one of that Fellowſhip at the</hi> Mews, <hi>which was called the</hi> Black guard, <hi>and to have cheated divers Tradeſmen in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:199172:60"/> and about the City, of Goods to a conſiderable value; and to have been aſſiſtant to</hi> Norton, <hi>in ſelling the Privy Garden at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>by a falſe Patent, to a Carpenter to build upon; but to have drawn ſeveral Bills of Exchange, to the value of Four or Five hundred pounds, on Mr.</hi> Roger Moor, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in</hi> Dublin, <hi>for ſuch ſums of money, received of Mr.</hi> Henry Crook <hi>and Mr.</hi> James Wale, <hi>here in</hi> London, <hi>which Bills were all returned proteſted.</hi> In the mean time, let no man think, that this baſe and profligate fellow, is the Sir <hi>James Hays</hi> who belonged to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and who hath married the Lady <hi>Falkland,</hi> ſeeing this worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is a perſon of more Honour and Integrity, than to fall under a ſuſpicion of doing any thing that is ill. And as they, whom I have mentioned, are the Witneſſes whom ſome wiſe men thought fit to have concealed, when the reſt that pretend to ſwear a <hi>Proteſtant Plot,</hi> were called forth, and produced upon the publick Stage, ſo whether the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors and Managers of this Intrigue, do only reſerve them till the much deſired ſeaſon of having Juries who will act implicetly, or ſuch at leaſt, as will prove more favourable to the Deſign; or whether they have choſen to lay them wholly aſide, as being really aſhamed of them, I cannot tell. But ſo ſecure are we of our own Innocency, and ſo much above the aſperſions of ſuch vile Miſcreants, that we neither envy our Enemies the having a thouſand of them, nor think either our Lives endangered, or our Reputations leſſened, through being ſworn againſt by perſons ſtigmatized and branded as they are.</p>
               <p>And whereas there are ſome, either ſo ſilly or ſo knaviſh, as to ſay, that by weakning the Credit of the Evidence, concerning a <hi>Proteſtant Plot,</hi> we do thereby ſupplant, and in Sir <hi>George</hi>

For this Sham Conſpiracy, contrived and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the Papiſts means againſt Proteſtants, is both a moſt convincing Evidence of the reality of a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and that there are ſome people intereſted in it, which before we were not aware of. Nor was this Deſign of bringing Proteſtants under the ſuſpicion of Treaſon againſt His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Government, thought of, or undertaken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other or leſſer account, but in order to protect and defend themſelves from the puniſhments which they know they were juſtly obnoxious unto, for their own Treaſons. And had the Papiſts been guilty of no other Plot againſt us before, this alone is enough to tell us, how implacably they purſue our ruine. Yea, we could ſooner pardon thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:199172:61"/> of that Hereſie which had for ſo long a time rul'd over this</hi> Northern <hi>part of the world.</hi> And is not the murdering of Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey,</hi> both an indiſputable Evidence, that there was a Popiſh Plot, and that their deſtroying him, was meerly to prevent the diſcovery of their deſign for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying us? Yea, what any pretended to diſcover of that Plot, was ſo agreeable to Popiſh Principles, and did ſo correſpond with the preparations that we had obſerved them to be making for many years, that were there not one Witneſs alive, we could demonſtrate the truth of a Popiſh Conſpiracy, from Matters, Facts, and ſuch Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which were obvious. And as the fellows who have been ſuborned to ſwear againſt Proteſtants, were not the Original Diſcoverers of the Popiſh Plot, ſo Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> who did firſt detect and reveal that Helliſh Conſpiracy, is both forth-coming, and remains able to ſupport and maintain what he hath depoſed. And without doubt, his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will have a greater Reputation than ever, by his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many and great offers whereby he was tempted to ſwear Treaſon againſt Proteſtants. For his ſcorning to be brib'd to ſwear againſt us, is a moſt convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that what he ſwore againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> was not a Fiction of his own, invented upon Deſign of getting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and preferment. Nor is it to be thought, that they who make it their buſineſs to diſparage Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and to leſſen his Reputation, ſhould be either careful about the maintaining the belief of a Popiſh Plot, or of ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Credit of the Witneſſes, in order to their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing Good Evidence in the buſineſs of the Popiſh Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
               <p>And whereas there are others, and ſome of them not only men of Quality, but Wit, who ſay, That the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes having been believed againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they ought
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:199172:62"/> alſo to be believed againſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> ſeing, as they are pleaſed to expreſs it, <hi>What is ſawce for a Gooſe is alſo ſawce for a Gander:</hi> I reply, that if Paſſion, Prejudice and Envy would give theſe men leave to think coherently, as all ſober men uſe to do, they would ſoon find ſuch a diſparity and difference in theſe two caſes, that there is no reaſon they ſhould be credited againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe Faith was given to their Teſtimony when they ſwore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For it is one thing to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hidden Machinations and Deſigns of Prieſts, who were their Confeſſors, had the direction of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and with whom they had been long and familiarly acquainted, and another thing to be made privy to the moſt important and hazardous Secrets of perſons with whom they they never had any intimacy, and to whom they never ſpake, unleſs it were either concerning what they pretended to know of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> or in reference to their getting bread and ſuſtenance allowed them. Surely there is a great diſparity betwixt their being believed about matters communicated unto them, before they were known to have deceived thoſe that had put confidence in them; and their being believed concerning Deſigns, which they ſay were truſted with them, after all the world knew how they had diſcovered and betrayed their antient Friends who did rely upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor is there any <hi>pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>y</hi> betwixt the giving credit to men about an affair where both the Matter that is ſworn, and the Circumſtances by which it is enforced, do demonſtrate the truth and reality of what is Depoſed; and the receiving their Teſtimony concerning a buſineſs that is full of Contradictions and moral impoſſibilities. Nay, it is one thing to believe a man concerning a thing, the doing whereof was agreeable to the Principles which he profeſſed, and for the concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:199172:62"/> of which he was under an Oath of Secrecy; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing to believe him about a matter that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Religion both of thoſe that are ſaid to have truſted him, and which Religion himſelf had eſpouſed, becauſe it did prohibit ſuch Villanies, and for the concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof he was never brought under any ties and obligations. No perſon that hath not abjured Honeſty and common ſenſe, but muſt needs acknowledg that there is a great difference betwixt admitting the Teſtimony of one, who no ways appears to be tampered with, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuch an one's Depoſition for legal and true, who is known to have been hired and ſuborned. So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, we <hi>ſhall finde Sawce for their Gooſe,</hi> but in the mean time we defie them <hi>to find ſawce for their Gander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Nor is it equal, that becauſe theſe Witneſſes have been believed about a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> whereof we are furniſhed with an hundred Evidences beſides their Teſtimony; that they ſhould therefore be believed in reference to a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Conſpiracy</hi> againſt His Majeſty and the Monarchy, whereof we have no footſtep nor ſymptome, but muſt take it upon their mere <hi>Affidavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having now conſider'd the quality and the credibility of the Witneſſes, we are in the next place to weigh &amp; ponder the matter which they Depoſed and Swore. And if our Underſtanding and Reaſon do not deceive us, we ſhall: make the whole Forgery palpable, from what they have taken upon them to ſay againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> tho' there were no antecedent Reaſons for the bringing their credit as to this affair into Suſpicion. For if a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Depoſed be either contradictory to it ſelf, or morally impoſſible, or in the principal ſtrokes and lines of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the univerſal knowledg of the Nation, or doth interfore with the indelible Principles of the party that is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:199172:63"/> accuſed, or be found to thwart the Paſſions and Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he is ſuppoſed to be ſwayed by, the Forgery does thereby become as obvious to all thinking people, as if they had been preſent at the <hi>Conſults</hi> and <hi>Cabals</hi> where the things to be Sworn were deviſed, invented and laid. Nor is it unworthy of our Obſervation, that tho' the Treaſon which they are pleaſed to ſwear and declare, be both ſo horrid in it ſelf, and importing ſo great danger to His Majeſty's perſon, yet they did not immediately reveal it as became them to have done. <hi>Bracton</hi> ſays, <hi>That he who doth not diſcover Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

And when we conſider how much the King's Life, Crown and Dignity were in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, if that be true which they Depoſe, we cannot but judg of the Witneſſes as a company of Diſloyal Raſcals, and that it was not from Principles of Loyalty, nor from a ſenſe of their Duty, that they were brought at laſt to make this Diſcovery. Nay their concealing it without any juſt and reaſonable cauſe ſo long, is more than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that this Conſpiracy, wherewith they charge this Noble Peer and other great and worthy Proteſtants, is nothing but a late Forgery of their own, and that they take upon them to detect vvhat never really vvas, upon the Subornation of others, and for the accompliſhing ſome baſe, mercinary and villanous ends. Nor can there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:199172:63"/> be a clearer proof of the Folly of theſe Fellovvs and the Falſhood of vvhat they ſvvear, than that ſome of them repreſent themſelves to have diſcourſed all the while with the greateſt Loyalty, when in the mean time they introduce My Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">

                  <hi>the Plot in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and that he was as well ſatisfied with the coming in of</hi> Popery <hi>as the Duke of</hi> York; <hi>and that the Parliament was ſatisfied he was as much for it as his Brother;</hi> (for ſo the Wretch ſwore in Court, tho' the laſt words be left out in the Print) all this, I ſay, is feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and invented, ſeeing Major <hi>Manley,</hi> who was preſent and by all that time (albeit <hi>Smith</hi> concealed that upon the giving his Evidence) is ready to Depoſe upon Oath, that there was not one Syllable ſpoken by my <hi>Lord</hi> to the purpoſe which this Miſcreant ſwears. Let us add to this, <hi>Hayns</hi>'s Depoſing, <hi>That he had</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>a long diſcourſe with the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>at a Cooks in</hi> Ironmonger-lane, <hi>in a little Room next the Kitchin,</hi> (where by the way, that laſt expreſſion is left out in the Print) and we ſhall find this whole Forgery ſtill more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and palpable. For as My Lord was never there, except when he dined with divers Noble and Worthy Perſons: So beſides the improbability of his leaving the company and ſociety of men of the beſt Quality in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> to come and talk with ſuch a Fellow as <hi>Hayns,</hi> and beſides the abſurdneſs that is in ſuppoſing the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to have ſtaid an hour in a little Room by a Cook's Kitchin; not only the Servants of the houſe do poſitively affirm the contrary of all that this Raſcal ſwears, but divers Noble Perſons are ready to teſtifie that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> never came down ſtairs out of the great Room, till he was going away, and that he took Coach immediately, without withdrawing into any Room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:199172:65"/> But that which is extravagant beyond all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and which proclaims to every wiſe man the falſhood of all they have ſworn, is <hi>Hayns</hi>'s depoſing, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>ſhould not only ſay, There are Families in</hi> England <hi>which have as much pretence to the Crown as the King; but that the Duke of</hi> Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>hath in Right of his Mother as good a Title to the Crown, as ever any</hi> Steward <hi>had.</hi> Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to introduce the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> talking Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, but he muſt be likewiſe expoſed as talking ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly? Surely the Superintenders and Managers of this Plot, in the guilt whereof they would involve <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> muſt either be of very weak Underſtandings themſelves, or they muſt apprehend the generality of Mankind to be ſo, otherwiſe they could never hope to impoſe upon the world by ſuch nonſenſical ſtuff as this is. For beſides that no man knows of any Title whereby the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> can pretend to the Crown, the Right of claiming by his Mother, as ſprung from the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together groundleſs; ſo there is not ſo ſublime a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham,</hi> as that for advancing the Duke to the Throne my Lord ſhould not only venture his own life &amp; fortune, but diſoblige the beſt Friends he hath in the Nation, and entangle his native Country in Civil War. This miſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture in the Teſtimony of one of the moſt conſiderable Witneſſes, betrays not only their Folly, but that the whole Plot, whereof the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> hath been accuſed, is a malicious Forgery, in order to take away the Life of that innocent Peer. Nor can any, who are not willing to ſacrifice the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, the Liberties of their Country, and the Lives of Guiltleſs Perſons to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Rage of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> give any Credit to Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199172:65"/> who Swear at ſo Wilde and Nonſenſical a rate. Had the Mercinary vvretches deſigned to publiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for <hi>Liars</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors</hi> to all the vvorld, they could not have taken a more effectual vvay to do it, than by affirming, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſhould be deſirous to enter into a Combination and Conſpiracy vvith <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, in order to prevent a Popiſh Succeſſor, and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Proteſtant Religion. For at the ſame time that <hi>Dennis</hi> chargeth this Noble Perſon vvith ſaying, <hi>That he would extirpate the King and all his Family, he ſwears, That he deſired him to write to his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ubi ſupra, p. 32.</note> Iriſh <hi>Popiſh Friends, to be ready to aſſiſt.</hi> And tho' I do not much vvonder to find a <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> of the ſize of <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Wit and Underſtanding, ſwear a buſineſs vvhich diſproveth it ſelf before all Wiſe and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional perſons; yet I cannot forbear marvelling, that they vvho vievv'd the Depoſitions, and vvere to gloſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Evidence, vvould ſuffer ſuch a Depoſition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the publick Stage, vvhich vvould not only make the Forgery notorious, but infallibly expoſe themſelves, as well as the perjur'd Rogues, to the laughter, ſcorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of mankind. Nor is it unworthy of remark, that in the expreſſions which they ſwear my Lord <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> uſed, they make him not only forget the Loyalty of a Subject, but the Civility and Breeding of a Gentleman. For the <hi>Terms</hi> wherein they repreſent him ſpeaking of the King, are beſides their being Treaſonable, too rude to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any that knows the meaſures of Civility, or hath been occaſioned to ſpeak with any kind of <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> For not only <hi>Macknamarra</hi> introduceth him calling the King, <hi>a Faithleſs Perſon, and one that was no way to be believed:</hi> But <hi>Haynes</hi> will have him both to ſay, <hi>That the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:199172:66"/> King had no more Religion than a Horſe, and that he was degenerated into a perfect</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 28. p. 43. p. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Beaſt, and that he durst as ſoon be hang'd, as to meddle with the ſaid</hi> Haynes, <hi>if he stuck to his Information about Sir</hi> Edmond-bury Godfrey'<hi>s Murder.</hi> This is a <hi>Dialect</hi> proper for ſuch Raſcals as the Witneſſes to uſe; but it is not a Stile that men of Quality are accuſtomed unto, or can allow themſelves to ſpeak in. For how much ſoever they may be offended with the ways and methods of Princes, yet they conſtantly ſpeak of their Perſons with Reſpect and Deference. Whether are we to eſteem it a Subject fit for our mirth and laughter, or for our diſguſt and indignation, to ſee a Fellow appear at a <hi>Bar,</hi> againſt a Great and Wiſe Peer, and among other Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Expreſſions, whereof he accuſeth him, to ſwear, That the ſaid <hi>Lord</hi> put a greater Reſpect and Valuation upon him, than he did upon the King himſelf? <hi>Haynes</hi> having ſent to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſeveral other Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, That he would make conſiderable Diſcoveries, if they would procure him a Pardon, the Raſcal ſwears, That being in Diſcourſe with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> about that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my Lord ſhould ſay, <hi>If the King would not grant the Pardon for him, that was deſired, they would raiſe the whole Kingdom against him; and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that he muſt not expect to live peaceably in his Throne, if he did not grant it.</hi> For not to inſiſt on this, That the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> never ſpake with <hi>Haynes,</hi> nor would not ſo much as ſee him, both which will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as far as Negatives are capable, can any man that hath not renounced Senſe as well as Conſcience, believe that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> would put the Life of the King, and the Peace of the Kingdom in competition with <hi>Haynes</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardoned or not pardoned? For ſuppoſe that the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:199172:66"/> undertook to make very uſeful and important Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, provided he might have a Pardon; yet we muſt be Bruits, before we can be perſwaded, that a perſon of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Conduct ſhould, in caſe a pitiful wretch were not ſecured againſt the danger of the Gallows to which he ſtood obnoxious, threaten not only to dethrone a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, to whom he lies under many Obligations, beſides thoſe of Fealty, but to hurl a quiet and peaceable Nation into War and Blood. And as if it were not enough for theſe ſilly, as well as malicious wretches, to make my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſay a Thouſand things which are equally Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abſurd as they are Treaſonable, they will have him to have talk'd of matters ready to be done; which being duly weighed, will be found to have been morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For ſo is all that is ſworn againſt him, concerning a Deſign to ſeize the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was not only ſurrounded with his Guards, but, as our Enemies muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, environed with many Loyal Peers and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Nor are we told of any preparations that were ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to an undertaking which was ſo difficult in it ſelf, and which would be extreamly fatal to the Authors, if it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried. For whereas they depoſe, <hi>That my Lord told them, the Members came well</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Smith, <hi>p. 26.</hi>

                  <hi>Horſed and well Armed,</hi> the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knows the contrary. Some of the Members went ſo ill attended, as that they were not in a condition to ſecure themſelves from being Rob'd by the way. And divers of the moſt <hi>Martial</hi> perſons in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> went thither in <hi>Hackney Coaches,</hi> with ſcarce a Servant a peice to wait upon them. Yea, this very <hi>Earl,</hi> who is ſaid not only to have projected the ſeizing the King at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> but to have correſponded with others, in order to their coming provided thither with ſtrength and force,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:199172:67"/> for the accompliſhing of it, had neither Coach nor Horſe there himſelf. So ignorant was this Noble Perſon of any ſuch deſign, and ſo unprepared for the execution of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that nature, that he went down in an hired Coach, and was forc'd to ſtay there after the Diſſolution of the Parliament, till he ſent to <hi>London</hi> for Horſes, to convey and accommodate him home. Was not the Concourſe at <hi>Oxford</hi> much ſmaller than was reckoned upon, conſidering the Greatneſs and Solemnity of the Occaſion? It cannot be thought, that the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> and the principal Gentry of the Kingdom, ſhould go to to ſo <hi>August</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> an Aſſembly, without ſome Menial Servants to attend them. And if the having ſupernumeraries in a Retinue, be Foundation to raiſe a juſt ſuſpition of a Plot, the Lords and Commons to whom ſome give the Character of being more Loyal than the reſt of His Majeſties Subjects, will be moſt liable to ſuſpicion. Our Adverſaries would greatly oblige us, if they would tell us, where the Forces vvere raiſed that vvere to be employed in this Traterous Fact, and hovv they remained inviſible in their coming together, and parting again. It vvas the indiſpenſable duty of His Majeſties Officers, to have diligently enquired after theſe things: And ſurely the Miniſters have had opportunity, as vvell as inclination to have done it long before novv. And vvhereas vve are <hi>told of Fifty men, and thoſe perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who had others to attend them, that were liſted for a Guard to the Earl of</hi> Shaftſbury;<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 21.</note>

                  <hi>of them.</hi> Nor is the perjur'd Rogue able to give the world an account where he bought the <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe,</hi> which he pretends to have provided in order to the Deſign, nor in what Stable he kept him to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that Service. Would our Enemies have the world believe the incredible Crimes wherewith they have gotten us charged? Alas, all men who have either a grain of Wit or Honeſty left, will ſooner look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as Malicious and Blood thirſty Impoſtors. It would require a Book, rather than a <hi>Paragraph,</hi> throughly to inſpect and diſcourſe the <hi>matter</hi> which the Witneſſes have Sworn, and from thence to unveil the whole Myſtery, and detect the Forgery of this <hi>Protestant</hi> Plot. What can be more ridiculous in it ſelf, or more diſcover the Villany of this Intrigue, than to hear a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Wretches ſwear, that a prudent and wiſe man has been engaged in a Conſpiracy to deſtroy the Monarchy, and to eſtabliſh a Commonwealth, when the doing it were to ruin himſelf and all the <hi>Peerage</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> No man out of <hi>Bedlam</hi> can be ſo diſtracted, as to embark in a Deſign which would bring himſelf into a level with thoſe above whom he is raiſed, and upon whoſe Reſolves thoſe of his Order and Rank in the preſent Government, have by the Conſtitution a perfect <hi>Negative.</hi> Ambition is that which uſually inſpires men to great and hazardous Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and he muſt be ſuppoſed a Fool, that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in an affair that would leſſen and degrade both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his Poſterity, as well as the Nobility of his Country. Nor could he expect any man of Greatneſs and Intereſt to join with him in a Project ſo inconſiſtent with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:199172:68"/> their Honour and the Figure which under the Eſtabliſhed Legal Government they make in the State. Nor is the altering the Monarchy into a Commonvvealth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Allegiance, than it is repugnant to his Intereſt and thoſe indelible Principles of Civil Knovvledg and Policy vvhich he is imbu'd vvith, and hath alvvays pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. What can be imagined more abſurd, than that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Peers and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>England</hi> ſhould combine to accelerate their ovvn ruin in Apprehending and Depoſing the King, vvho is our only Security and Protection againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> Slavery and Arbitrarineſs? Tho' Princes have been ſometimes laid aſide by a diſcontented people, when the people have had a proſpect of bettering their Condition under him who vvas likely to ſucceed; yet never any conſpired to deſtroy a juſt and merciful Prince, to make vvay for one in his room that implacably hated both them and their Religion, and vvho had reſolved and determined their ruin. Nor hath it been ever knovvn, that the ſame Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (eſpecially when the conſequences have been fatal and deſtructive to the firſt Authors) hath been acted twice in the ſame Age. And therefore the reviving the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the late War, inſtead of ſerving to raiſe Fears and Jealouſies of another, doth to all thinking people demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate there can be none, unleſs the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould begin a Rebellion and Maſſacre in <hi>England,</hi> as they did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and in ſuch a caſe I know not but that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may both endeavour to defend their Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Swords of their Enemies, and to be revenged upon thoſe bloody men. And were not ſome people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of all Modeſty, as they have abandoned all Truth and Juſtice, they would be aſhamed of filling the Nation with Jealouſies of a new Civil War; unleſs they know of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:199172:68"/> ſuch who are reſolved either to extirpate us, as well as to overthrow all our Rights and Liberties, if by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Arms we do not defend both our ſelves and them.</p>
               <p>To all that hath been ſaid concerning the Infamy of the Witneſſes, and from the abſurdity of the matter which they have Depoſed, in order to the detection of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> we might ſtill render their Teſtimony more palpably falſe, by obſerving how they ſtudiouſly endeavour to put an eſtimate and value upon themſelves, beyond what they are capable of having, and all this in order and ſubſerviency to their being the better believed concerning the Treaſons whereof they had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us. For knowing that there was no reaſon why any Faith ſhould be given unto them, and being apprehenſive they would not be believed, how do they endeavour by Proteſtations and otherwiſe to ſupport and fortifie their own Credit? Accordingly <hi>Smith,</hi> before he entred upon the giving his Evidence againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> deſired leave to wipe off the Aſperſions which lay upon him about <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Trial, (<hi>which words by the by, are left out in the Print</hi>) namely, That whereas it had been reported that he Swore a<note place="margin">

For not to inſiſt upon this, that he ſwore at <hi>Colledges</hi> Trial, <hi>That</hi> Colledg <hi>told him, the Parliament was agreed to ſeize the King, and that the City was provided;</hi> which is in effect the very things which at the <hi>proceedings</hi> upon the <hi>Bill</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:199172:69"/> he would have vindicated himſelf from, as aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only eaſt upon him; I ſay, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon this, what elſe meant that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,<note place="margin">See <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Trial, <hi>p. 28. 27.</hi>
                  </note> but that he would have retrieved a credit with the Jury, which he knew he had forfeited, and impoſe an opinion of his Honeſty upon them, being jealous that they might think he had loſt all pretenſions to any ſuch thing. It is alſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ſerves to diſcover their Falſhood in what they ſwore againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make themſelves valuable and worthy to be truſted by great and wiſe men, by pretending a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Tranſactions of the world, and affairs of Kingdoms, which as they were never capable of attaining, ſo they had but betrayed their Folly and Vanity in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcourſe concerning ſuch things to that knowing and ſagacious Peer. For to hear <hi>Hayn</hi>'s depoſe, <hi>That he gave my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury<note place="margin">See Proceedings at the <hi>Old-Bayly, p. 27.</hi>
                  </note>

Alas! an acquaintance with the Occurrences of Princes Reigns, and a being able to declare the affairs of two Regencies in their dependence and order, with the Cauſes and Reaſons of a War which few can penetrate into the grounds of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:199172:69"/> nor to be expected from one that is not wonderfully converſant in the Memoire and Regiſters of Civil matters, and who hath enjoyed an intimate acquaintance with thoſe that were intereſted in the management both of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Military Concernments. Their Malice and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in this whole Affair, are open and palpable, by their indirect and evaſive anſwers to plain and eaſie queſtions. Such was <hi>Booth</hi>'s reply to Mr. <hi>Papilion,</hi> who having ask'd him, whether he knew any of<note place="margin">Proceed. p. 36.</note> the Fifty men which he had depoſed were liſted under Captain <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver directly knew, or converſed with any of them.</hi> And ſuch alſo was <hi>Haynes</hi>'s reply to the queſtion which was put to him, concerning his having given an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to a Juſtice of Peace, of a deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 42, 43.</note> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> for as he wrigled to and fro a great while, before he could be brought to acknowledg it, the anſwer was neither full nor ingenuous. Again, Their not remembring times and ſeaſons, when ſuch things which they ſwore ſhould be ſpoken, or when they gave in their Informations about them, does proclaim the Witneſſes to be Impoſtors, and whatſoever they depoſed, to be nothing but Forgery. For ſeveral of the things which they declared they could not remember, were ſuch, as it is morally impoſſible they ſhould forget them. Thus <hi>Haynes</hi> could not tell the time when the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſpake<note place="margin">Ibid. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>the Treaſonable words, about making the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>King:</hi> Nor could either <hi>Smith</hi> or <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville tell, when they gave in their Informations againſt my Lord, nor whether it was before or</hi>

There was not that modeſty to be ſeen in their Behaviour, nor that ſimplicity in their Evidence, nor that plainneſs, eaſineſs and directneſs in their Anſwers, which was agreeable to Truth; but their whole carriage, and the manner of their delivering themſelves, was ſtarch't huffing, artificial, and full of trick.</p>
               <p>But whereas there is a Paper ſtiled, <hi>An Aſſociation,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be found, among other Writings, in the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury's Cloſet,</hi> that morning he was apprehended; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, great ſtreſs is laid towards the proving a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of this Lord, and other Proteſtants, againſt His Majeſty and the Government, I ſhall therefore with all that modeſty which becomes me, in reference to perſons in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and yet with all that freedom which the Innocency of Peers and Gentlemen, unjuſtly accuſed, doth require, take this Paper a little into conſideration, and make ſome juſt and modeſt Reflections in reference unto it. An <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> for the preſervation of the King and the Proteſtant Religion, if it be duly drawn, and contain nothing in it contrary to the Rights and Prerogatives of His Majeſty, the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the People, will neither be found ſo new, nor ſo ſurpriſing a thing, as that the Grand Juries of the ſeveral Counties ſhould be influenced and perſwaded to abhor it. For our Anceſtors in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that the <hi>Queens</hi> Life, the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion, were in danger from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:199172:70"/> upon the hope they had of a Popiſh Succeſſor, in caſe of the Queens Death, they thereupon entred into an Aſſociation, for the preſervation of her Majeſties Life, and the revenging her Death, if ſhe ſhould have periſhed by violent hands; which inſtead of being ridicul'd and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt, was not only unanimouſly ſubſcribed by the moſt conſiderable perſons in the Kingdom, but both appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ratified by an <hi>Act</hi> of the Parliament that next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. But whether it was, that our Forefathers loved the <hi>Queen,</hi> and were more zealous for their Religion, than we love his preſent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and are zealous for <hi>ours;</hi> or whether they thought there was more danger to be feared from <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was then the apparent Popiſh Succeſſor, than we think there is from a Gentleman of the ſame Principles with her, that hath the ſame and more palpable pretences to the Crown, I ſhall not take upon me to determine. However, it is not unknown, that Two ſeveral late Parliaments being convinced of the dangers which His Majeſties Life is in from the Papiſts, that they may accelerate the aſcent of one of their own Communion to the Throne, did after mature Debate, and as a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the greateſt Loyalty they could pay His Majeſty, come to this Reſolve:</p>

               <p>Yea, the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament, being deeply ſenſible what Plots the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were embark'd in for the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:199172:71"/> of the King, the extirpation of the reformed Religion in theſe Kingdoms, and the placing the Crown upon the head of a Popiſh Prince, they ordered a Bill for an <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> to be brought into the Houſe. And whereas Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> depoſeth upon Oath, <hi>That tho he heard of ſuch a thing as an Aſſociation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpoken of about the Town, yet he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the debate, to the beſt of his remembrance;</hi> I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that either his memory is very ſlippery, or there are a great many Gentlemen who have remembred more than is true. For it is not only ſaid, that he was preſent at the Debate, but that he oppoſed the <hi>Bill</hi> as well as he could; and we may be ſure no man could do it better, ſeeing as he ſaid upon another occaſion, he had been all his days em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd not only in the ſtudy of the Laws of his Country, but in the Laws of Nations There is a ſtory which I do not in the leaſt intend to apply to Sir <hi>L.</hi> for it may be applicable to others for miſrepreſenting him. But the ſtory is, That a Prieſt being accuſed after the Aſſaſſination of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> for having heard in Confeſſion from <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> that he intended to murder that great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, replied that among other mercies which God had beſtowed upon him, <hi>He had given him the gift of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs.</hi> But to return; as there was ſuch a Bill brought into the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> ſo it is not only very likely that there were ſeveral Copies of it, but we may rationally imagine that there might be ſeveral Draughts of Bills pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, before one could be pitched upon, that would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the fundamental Laws of the Land, effectual for the preſervation of his Majeſty, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, &amp; becoming the Wiſdom of that Houſe. And as Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> hath been pleaſed to acknowledg to ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, That among other papers ſeized in the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:199172:71"/> Cloſet, which were brought to him, there were two or three <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Aſſociation</hi> different from that read and committed in the Houſe of Commons; all which we may ſuppoſe to have contained nothing but what was ſafe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there have been no endeavours to make my Lord guilty of High Treaſon upon them; ſo who knows, but that if this Paper which was read in Court, was found in his Lordſhips Cloſet, but that it might be a Draught of a <hi>Bill</hi> for an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> which this Noble Peer as much abhorred as any Country-Jury could. Nor is this ſo wild a Phanſie, as ſome men out of weakneſs of underſtanding, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of mind, may believe; for ſeeing there was nothing in the Indictment againſt this Noble Peer, that either related unto, or was grounded upon this <hi>Paper,</hi> we may very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conceive, that the omitting it was built upon ſome ſuch Reaſon as we have now ſuggeſted. For if one of the ends of the Aſſociation aim'd at, be, as my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice North</hi> was pleaſed to inform the Jury, <hi>not only to deſtroy the Mercinary Forces in and about the City of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, <hi>but to ſettle the Authority in the Major part of the Members of Parliament during the ſitting of it, excluſive of the King;</hi> I can ſee no reaſon, unleſs the Managers knew that they could make nothing of that Paper before wiſe and honeſt men, as truly knowing of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi> unconcernment in it, why the Indictment ſhould not rather have been ſuperſtructed upon it, than upon the Teſtimony of any of the Oral Witneſſes. But beſides all this, the bare having a Treaſonable Paper in a mans houſe, which as poſſibly he knew not whence it came, ſo he never communicated it to any, to the prejudice of his Majeſty and the Government, is not ſo criminal a matter, as men ſway'd meerly by Paſſion and Hatred, do believe it to be. And were the having ſeen an ill Paper, or its being found
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:199172:72"/> in a mans Cloſet, to be expiated with no leſs than his life, may be very few, even of thoſe that are ſo clamourous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> would prove innocent, or find themſelves to be ſafe. But what if after all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy which this Noble Lord hath undergone, in reference to that Paper, it ſhould appear that he never ſaw it, nor hath any cauſe to think it was there, where it was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be found? And I ſhall the rather enquire into this, and endeavour to unfold it, becauſe my L. C. J. <hi>North</hi> declared, <hi>There was a great matter to be preſumed upon it,</hi> it having been found under lock and key in my Lords Study. For as Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> who ſeized the Paper, <hi>would not ſay, that it is the Earl of</hi> Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>hand,</hi> tho' if he had pleaſed, he could have ſaid poſitively that it was not his hand; ſo I am apt to think, that upon a thorough enquiry into the conduct of this affair, we ſhall not find reaſon to be confident, that it was found in my Lords Study. Nay Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſitively ſwear as <hi>to that Paper in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> That <hi>it was taken in the Earl of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Shaftsbury's <hi>Cloſet; only ſwears in general, that the Papers which were put up in a velvet Bag, were ſeized there.</hi> And it is remarkable, that whereas Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> depoſeth, <hi>That as ſoon as he came</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>to</hi> Thanet-Houſe, <hi>my Lord gave him the keys of his Cloſets, and told him where they were;</hi> this could no ways be, ſeeing the key of one of them, namely, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtairs, was always kept by ſome or other of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Servants; ſo that Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> could at moſt but receive it by my Lords order. And as one or other of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury's</hi> Servants had conſtantly the keeping of the key of the lower Cloſet, ſo there were always many Papers of their own in it, it being the Room where they manage
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:199172:72"/> moſt of their Buſineſs. But that which is moſt ſurprizing of all, is, That Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> ſwears, <hi>There were none preſent when he put up the Papers beſides himſelf, but my Lords own Servants;</hi> whereas it can be proved by unqueſtionable Witneſſes, that there were no fewer than five or ſix, ſuch as he brought along with him in the Cloſet when he was there, and as buſie in putting up Papers as himſelf. And that which ſtill encreaſeth our Suſpition, that things are not ſo fair in this matter, as they are repreſented, is, That my Lord having offered to put his Seal on the Trunk, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he might firſt <hi>ſchedule</hi> and inventory the Papers; Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> poſitively refuſed to allow him that Favour, I will not ſay Right and Juſtice. And this is a Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Importance, that if duly ponder'd, my Lord will not be found, according to Law and Equity, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for any Paper that was pretended to be taken there. For no man ought to be called to anſwer for Writings ſaid to be ſeized in his houſe, to whom the ſcheduling of them was refuſed. When Monſieur <hi>Fouket</hi> was committed by the <hi>French</hi> King, and all endeavours uſed to put him to death for Crimes againſt his Maſter, which they alledged his own Papers were ſufficient to convict him of, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had been taken from him without allowing him to endorſe and inventory them, the evidence againſt him from his Writings was rejected and judged weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid upon that alone account. And yet all the World knows that as the <hi>French</hi> Monarch is more abſolute, and leſs merciful than our King, ſo their Laws are not more tender of the lives of the Subjects, than ours are. But that ſome men can allow themſelves a great latitude in ſwearing vvhen it is ſubſervient to a Deſign, appears in that <hi>Mr.</hi> Blathvvait <hi>not only ſwears that that Paper was put into his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:199172:73"/> hand by Mr.</hi> Gwyn <hi>Clerk of the Council, but that Mr.</hi> Gwyn <hi>had ſeiſed it among others in my Lord</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 13.</note> Shaftsbury's <hi>houſe;</hi> whereas Mr. <hi>Blathwaite</hi> not having been there when the Papers were taken, could have only Depoſed, had he been careful in what he ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> told him ſo. How could he that was not there, Swear ſo particularly that ſuch a Paper was found in my Lord's <hi>Cloſet,</hi> unleſs he ſwore implicitely and upon the inſtruction of another? He might as well have taken his Oath, that they who went to apprehend the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> carried Papers along with them thither, as that they found that Paper there and brought it thence. And whereas Mr. <hi>Blathwaite</hi> further ſwears, <hi>That the Trunk wherein the Papers were, which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>was committed to his keeping by Mr.</hi> Gwyn, <hi>was ſealed, and that it was opened in the preſence of Mr.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>and Mr.</hi> Starkey: This ſeems to be ſaid only by way of Artifice, to obtain belief, that the Paper ſtiled <hi>an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> was truly found among my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſeeing if the Trunk was ſealed, neither my <hi>Lord</hi> or any of his Servants knew of the ſealing of it; and they who had the Trunk, had alſo the Seal wherewith it is ſaid to have been ſealed, in their own cuſtody, and might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly open it, and either put in or take out what they pleaſed. Upon the whole, Did this Paper contain in it the moſt Treaſonable things imaginable, yet it doth not appear that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> is accountable for it; or that it is fair, juſt, or candid, to bring it in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him upon a charge of High-Treaſon, with a deſign and expectation to take away his Life by vertue of it.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>There is one thing more relating to the proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:199172:73"/> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which requires ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon it; and that is concerning the manage and conduct of that buſineſs in the <hi>Old-Baily.</hi> I will not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp that <hi>French Term</hi> which hath been lately naturalized in one of our High Courts of Juſtice, and ſay that there was <hi>Chicanery</hi> in it; but things do not appear to have been carried with that equality and impartialneſs betwixt the King and ſo great and deſerving a Subject, as the Law and common Uſage do direct unto, and preſcribe. No kind of procedure is further for the King's Honour and Intereſt, than as it is according to Law, vvhich is the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the King's Prerogative, Glory and Safety, as well as the Rule by which we are to be protected in our Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Lives if innocent, as well as caſt and convicted, if upon Trial we be found to have Capitally offended. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever wrong is done againſt any of His Majeſty's Subjects, in the ſenſe of the Law done againſt the King and the Honour of His Government; ſeeing he is the Spring and Fountain of Juſtice to all his People. And it is a great Aſperſion upon the Juſtice as well as Goodneſs of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to have things ſo tranſacted, as if the King were more concerned to have a perſon that is barely accuſed found guilty, than he is to have him appear and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Innocent. The vindication and defence of the Guiltleſs, is more the Princes Glory and Intereſt, than the Conviction and Condemnation of the Criminal. And when any perſon comes to be accuſed, all that is for the Honour of the King, is to have the Truth diſcovered, and Juſtice impartially take place. And whoſoever are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Proſecutors to prove an Accuſation or Charge, they are no further for the King, tho' they be called the King's Evidence, than as they declare the truth, and nothing but the truth. And if ſuch Fellows be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:199172:74"/> found, or juſtly ſuſpected to ſwear falſely againſt the Lives of His Majeſties Subjects, they are in reality Witneſſes againſt the King, by endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Loyal People, pervert his Juſtice, and bring his Perſon and Throne under the Guilt of ſhedding the Blood of Innocents. Now whereas there are ſeveral <hi>Statutes,</hi> upon which a perſon is liable to be Indicted for Treaſon; namely, that of the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and that of the 13. of this King, it is no leſs neceſſary than juſt, that the party accuſed ſhould know upon which of thoſe two <hi>Statutes</hi> he is Preſented and Charged. For ſeeing the <hi>one</hi> limiteth both the time of Proſecution and the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, while the <hi>other</hi> leaves the time unfixed and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, it is requiſite, that the Jury, who are to enquire upon the <hi>Bill</hi> that ſtands preferred before them, ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly underſtand upon which of thoſe Law the party is <hi>Indicted;</hi> for otherwiſe they cannot tell, whether the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences whereof he is accuſed, fall within the time which the <hi>latter</hi> of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> does preſcribe and determine. For tho' as my Lord Chief Juſtice truly ſaid, <hi>That what is Treaſon by the</hi> Statute<note place="margin">Proceedings at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> p. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>of</hi> 25. Edw. 3. <hi>is likewiſe Treaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the</hi> Statute <hi>of the 13. of this King,</hi> yet this laſt Statute provides, <hi>That no perſon or perſons, ſhall by Vertue of that Act, incur any of the penalties therein mentioned, unleſs he or they be proſecuted within Six months next after the Offence committed, and indicted thereupon within Three months after ſuch proſecution.</hi> Whereas the former Statute of the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3 leaves both the Proſecution and Indictment at the pleaſure of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, whether he will do it ſooner or later. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, upon which of theſe Statutes the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was Indicted, was the more needful and material in this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:199172:74"/> caſe, becauſe the time preſixed by the latter <hi>Statute</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed divers weeks, before any Bill of Indictment was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt him. Nor could a Jury upon the beſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the world, find a Bill againſt him, ſuppoſing it grounded upon that <hi>Statute,</hi> ſeeing the Indictment was not preferred within Three months after my <hi>Lord's Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which in the Language and Senſe of our Law, is a Proſecution. Yea, the making it diſtinctly known, upon which of theſe two <hi>Acts</hi> this Noble Peer was <hi>Indicted,</hi> was yet of more concernment to him, as to his ſafety, and more needful to the <hi>Jury,</hi> for the Guidance and Conduct of themſelves in what they were about, ſeeing words may be brought in, as Evidence of Treaſon upon the <hi>one</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but ſignifie nothing, without ſome further Overt-Act, upon the <hi>other.</hi> For as my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> very well ſaid, <hi>The latter Law had greatly altered the former, eſpecially in two caſes: Firſt, as</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Proceed. at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> p. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>to the levying of War, and the compaſſing of the King's Death, theſe were not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before, unleſs War had been actually levied, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the King's Death had been declared by an Overt-Act. Secondly, That the impriſoning, or reſtraining the Liberty of the King, were not of themſelves alone high Treaſon by the old Statute, but were now made Treaſon by this laſt Law, during His Majeſtie; Life.</hi> And as his Lordſhip added, <hi>That for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it had been ſaid, and truly enongh, That words alone would not make Treaſon; but by this late Act, words, if they import any malicious deſign againſt the King's Life and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or any Traiterous intention in the party, ſuch words are Treaſon within this Act.</hi> Therefore the Evidence brought againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> being principally concerning words which he was ſaid to have ſpoken, the tenderneſs which the Adminiſtrators of publick Juſtice
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:199172:75"/> ought to maintain for the Lives of all men, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity which they ſhould preſerve in the Execution of the Laws, ſhould have obliged them to have been particular and diſtinct in publiſhing upon which of the two Laws this Noble Peer was indicted. For if he was indicted upon the firſt, then bare words without an over-act, were not to be allowed in proof of the Treaſons whereof he was accuſed; and if he vvas indicted upon the ſecond, then the <hi>Jury</hi> vvas to take no Cognizance of words ſpoken, vvithout the Circle and Compaſs of the time appointed by the Lavv, for proceeding againſt him. Nor doth the examining the Witneſſes in Court, leave any great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon the Managment of this Affair. For ſeeing our Anceſtors made it no leſs than Treaſon or Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for a Grand Jury to diſcover who was indicted before them, or what evidence was given them, it is a moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragrable Argument, that Witneſſes uſed not anciently to be examined in open Court. And it ſeems ſomething ſtrange, that another way of procedure ſhould be choſen againſt a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> accuſed of Treaſon, than hath at any times been uſed againſt Papiſts, indicted of the like Crime. And foraſmuch as Bills are to be returned only by the Grand Jury, as found or not found, ſo it would ſeem very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that they only are to be acquainted with the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon which the Opinion or Verdict are given. The <hi>Jurors Oath,</hi> namely, <hi>That the Kings Council, his fellows, and his own, he ſhall keep ſecret,</hi> tells us what was the ancient uſage in this particular. And whereas it was ſaid, <hi>That a Grand Jury is bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Proceed. p. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>the Kings ſecrets, ſo long as he will have them kept ſecret, but that it doth not deprive the King of the benefit of having them publick.</hi> This ſeems not to have been ſpoken by one that had well conſidered what he ſo
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:199172:75"/> openly delivered. For the King cannot alter or change the uſual or common Proceedings of our judicial Courts. Law and Cuſtom hath both ſetled the power of Juries, and the methods wherein they are to proceed in their Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in order to a Verdict; and the King can neither enlarge or leſſen the firſt, nor yet appoint them to vary in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But ſeeing my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice North</hi> hath been pleaſed to tell us, <hi>That the Judges having agreed, that the Witneſſes ſhould be examined</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>publickly, we are therefore to acquieſce,</hi> we ſhall readily obey him, being perſwaded that they did in this and all other things, as men that had a regard to their Oath, and not as men bound to their good behaviour, by holding their places <hi>durante beneplacito.</hi> However we may make this uſe of it, namely, that the Witneſſes being taken by a Jury of wiſe and ſubſtantial men, to have foreſworn themſelves in the face of the Kingdom, we may not only henceforth look upon them as a company of infamous Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcals, but we may very well expect, that the <hi>Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ſhould proſecute them in his Majeſties Name, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining to deſtroy innocent perſons. But that which doth moſt ſurprize all men, in reference to the management of this Affair at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> was the Kings Council appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Court to lead the Witneſſes, and not only open, but enforce the evidence. For a Perſon barely indicted, ſtands in the ſenſe of the Law probably innocent, till the Bill be found; and therefore no man till then ought to countenance one ſide more than another. And for the Kings Council to intereſt themſelves ſo far upon a bare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, as to make the King a Party for, or againſt the Perſon who ſtands charged, would ſeem to intimate, that there was ſomething elſe at the bottom of this affair, than meerly to have truth or falſehood appear. How eaſie is

And what encouragement do Mercinary Wretches take to accuſe innocent perſons, with boldneſs and impudence, when they find themſelves countenanced in what they ſwear?

                  <p>I thought to have ſubjoined an account of the <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Subſtractions</hi> and <hi>Alterations</hi> in the Printed Account of <hi>the Proceedings upon the Bill againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, as they have been compared with the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> which were taken by ſome of the beſt Short-hand Writers about the Town: But this Diſcourſe being ariſen already to a greater length than was intended, I ſhall wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the encreaſing it by things that are not eſſential to the vindication of our Innocency, and which poſſibly would only reflect upon the <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors employed. And therefore inſtead of that, I ſhall chuſe to give the world ſome further light concerning the affair of the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> his Caſe being a pattern of what our own may come to be, if the Counſels of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gentleman in the <hi>North</hi> do prevail. No Perſon of Quality in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſerved His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:199172:76"/> with greater Loyalty and Zeal when the King's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were loweſt, than this Gentleman did. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly his Majeſty, who when left to act ſuitably to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and inclinations, never forgets the good Offices of his Friends, was pleaſed to teſtifie what ſenſe he had of my Lord <hi>Lorn</hi>'s Services by a Letter directed from <hi>Collen,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 30. 1654. in which having told this Lord, <hi>How he had heard from</hi> Middleton, <hi>what Affection and Zeal he had ſhewn to his Service, and how conſtantly he adhered to him in all his Diſtreſſes; His Majeſty was pleaſed graciouſly to add, that he ſhould find him very juſt and kind in rewarding what he had done and ſuffered for him.</hi> But what this Earl acted and underwent for the King, when his Lordſhip's Father and almoſt all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation had either fallen in with or ſubmitted to the Uſurpers, will better appear by a Paper under <hi>Middleton</hi>'s hand, which I ſhall here annex.</p>

               <p>What his after-Sufferings for His Majeſty were, and how he continued ſix years a Priſoner under the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for his Loyalty to the King, I ſhall content my ſelf to have only barely ſuggeſted them. And as no man in all <hi>Scotland</hi> was more capable of ſerving his Prince, both by reaſon of the greatneſs of his Parts, the height of his Quality, and the largeneſs of his Intereſt, than this Noble Lord; ſo no perſon of one degree or another, hath at all times, and in various Employments and Truſts, more approved his Zeal and Loyalty to the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government, than he hath conſtantly done ſince His Majeſties Reſtoration. And if he have offended in any thing, it is by an exceſs of compliance with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:199172:77"/> Will, having as himſelf declared in his <hi>Speech</hi> at his <hi>Arraignment, ſerved him all along after his own way and manner.</hi> Nor can any wiſe man believe that what he was accuſed of High-Treaſon for, was either a Crime in it ſelf, or would have been charged upon this Earl as an Offence, if His Majeſties preſent <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had not upon ſome hidden and more important motive and inducement, conceived an implacable hatred againſt him. For the declining to ſwallow the <hi>Teſt</hi> abruptly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch limitations as might give it both a determinate and a legal ſenſe, cannot be imagined to be more criminal, than altogether to refuſe it; which not only many of the Conformable <hi>Clergy,</hi> but divers Peers and Gentlemen, without being accuſed of High Treaſon, have done. And ſurely it was more becoming a man of Honour and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to declare plainly and openly, in what ſenſe he could, and was ready to take it, <hi>than to take it with a pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout ignorance,</hi> as another Lord of His Majeſties Privy-Council did. And as the Council's publiſhing an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, is an unanſwerable Argument, that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome Explication, towards the reconciling it to its ſelf and the Laws of the Land; ſo wiſe men are apt to think, that it is as lawful for a perſon to explain it for himſelf, as for them to take upon them to explain it for others. But it ſeems very ſtrange, that it ſhould be Treaſon in the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> to declare in what Senſe he would take it, when at the ſame time others have been allowed to put Senſes and Conſtructions of their own upon it, which were more remote from the meaning of the words than his were. But that the World may be both able to judg of that Affair, and of the hard and unpreſidented uſage which this Noble perſon hath met with, I ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> ſubjoin the <hi>Explanation</hi> of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> for which he was Accuſed and Condemned of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:199172:78"/> High Treaſon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall annex an <hi>Explication</hi> which he had prepared of that <hi>Explanation,</hi> and which he threw into ſuch a Texture with the words of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that being read interwoven together, his purpoſe, meaning and deſign, will not only more clearly appear, but juſtifie themſelves to the minds of all rational men. And I ſhall add in the laſt place the <hi>Opinion</hi> of ſeveral of the beſt Lawyers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> concerning the Caſe of this Great and Loyal Peer.</p>

                  <p>WE have conſidered the Criminal Letters raiſed at the inſtance of His Majeſties Advocate againſt the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> with the Acts of Parliament contained and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in the ſame Criminal Letters, and have compared the ſame with a Paper or Explication which is Libelled to have been given in by the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> to the Lords of His Majesties Privy Council, and owned by him as the ſenſe and explication in which he did take the Oath impoſed by the late Act of Parliament; and which Paper is of this Tenor, <hi>I have conſidered the Teſt, and am very deſirous,</hi> &amp;c. And likewiſe having conſider'd, that the Earl after he had taken the Oath, with the explication and ſenſe then put upon it, it was acquieſced to by the Lords of the Privy Council, and the Earl allowed to take his place, and ſit and vote. And that before the Earl's taking of the Oath, there were ſeveral Papers
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:199172:79"/> ſpread abroad containing Objections and alledged Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Contradictions in the Oath. And that ſome thereof by Synods and Presbyteries of the Orthodox Clergy, to ſome of the Biſhops of the Church. It is our humble Opinion, that ſeeing the Earl's deſign and meanin in offering the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was allenarly for clearing of his own Conſcience, and is of no contravention of the Laws and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doth not at all import the Crimes Libelled againſt him; <hi>viz.</hi> Treaſon, Leiſing-making, Depraving of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Laws, or the Crime of Perjury: But that the Gloſſes and Inferences put by the Libel on the ſaid Paper, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrained, and unwarrantable, and inconſiſtent with the Earl's true Deſign, and the Sincerity of his meaning and intention in making of the ſaid Explication.</p>
